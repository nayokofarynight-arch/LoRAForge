His antennae point sharply upward, his nails become noticeably shorter and he maintains the lack of lines on his arms from his Power Awakening state. This form also causes a change to Piccolo's facial features, making his cheekbones more pronounced, jawline more chiseled, and his chin broader with a cleft, somewhat similar to the likes of Lord Slug and Pilina. Combined, the changes serve to give him a somewhat more brutish appearance.\n\nThe symbol of Namekian pride initially appears as a light orange glow above his gi before being branded onto the back in white color. The eruption of his ki is so intense it resembles a massive fiery geyser.\n\nIn the film, it retains the change to Piccolo's belt from red to black, while in artwork of the form by Toriyama it retains the usual red coloration.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nUsage and power\nALL THAT YOU HAVE... PLUS A BIT EXTRA.\nShenron granting Piccolo's wish in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero.\n\nOrange Piccolo is an evolved form of Piccolo's Power Awakening state and is currently his strongest transformation. The form gives Piccolo power on par with Goku and the others.[2] When Piccolo takes on this form Goten and Trunks are no longer able to detect his ki, though whether this is an innate trait of the transformation or a potential result of their incompetence is left ambiguous.[4]\n\nSuper Hero - Orange Piccolo vs Cell Max\nOrange Piccolo vs. Cell Max.\nIn Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, Piccolo achieved both his Power Awakening form as well as this higher-level form thanks to a wish from Shenron to unlock his potential, who grants him the latter as a bonus boost in strength. Though Piccolo's Power Awakening form began to lose grounds against Gamma 2, as Orange Piccolo, he completely turns the tides of battle, completely unfazed by Gamma 2's barrage of attack without any attempt to defend, and then promptly knocks Gamma 2 out in one blow. Later, against Cell Max, Piccolo is able to catch the monster's foot when he attempts to stomp on Gamma 2's lifeless body, and thanks to a reminder from Krillin, uses his Great Namekian form in tandem with his Orange form to fight Cell giant-to-giant. Despite being the only one able to put up a fight against Cell Max, Piccolo is eventually bested and severely injured by a barrage of ki, causing him to revert to his Ultimate state and triggering Gohan into entering his Beast form out of rage. Later, Piccolo recovers his Orange Great Namekian form to restrain Cell Max with Demon Hand, giving Gohan the opening to pierce Cell Max's weak point with one last Special Beam Cannon.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nEnhancement\nGreat Namekian - Piccolo can utilize his gigantification ability while in his Orange Piccolo form, however it does not increase his power in proportion to his increased mass.","quantity":11,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"s3pu3n7rm","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
