She has a rare ability called [Identify] which allows her to see the skills of others. Her name Luna was given to her by Rud as she didn't have a name when they met.\n\nAppearance\nShe has waist-length white hair, blue eyes and due to being a homunculus has a gem in the center of her chest.\n\nPersonality\nLuna is different than most homunculi as she is able to express emotions. Luna is initially shy around others although part of the reason for her shyness is because due to the distrust and mistreatment of homunculi by some people she is nervous around them due to the possibility that they might discover what she is and treat her differently due to her species. She also gets embarrassed easily.\n\nGallery\n\nTrivia\nPerhaps due to being a homunculus, Luna is able to quickly learn what she is taught.\nReferences\nMore Information\nComments\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\n","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"zgyt72p9f","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"ci32yb2uh","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"0tesbnyu4","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"a20huvmko","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"7banh87vo","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"i4vtfwd89","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"971gwfkk2","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
