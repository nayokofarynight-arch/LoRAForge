As the first companion to be summoned via Unlimited Gacha, she is also Light's first loyal partner who aids his quest of not only his vengeance against his his former party, but also learn truth about the Masters. She combines flawless beauty and absolute loyalty with a versatile and deadly set of skills, all while secretly harboring a deep love for her master, Light.\n\n\nContents\n1\tAppearance\n2\tPersonality\n3\tBackground\n4\tStory\n5\tAbilities\n6\tRelationships\n7\tTrivia\n00:04\n\n41:20\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\nMei is a breathtakingly beautiful girl, with an appearance so perfect she looks like a doll meticulously crafted by a god. She has long black hair that she keeps tied up in a neat ponytail. Her features are the closest to that of a \"common race\" among her peers. This allows her to easily blend in with normal people when on missions.\n\nPersonality\nOn the surface, Mei is a serious, intelligent, and composed individual. She flawlessly executes her duties as both head of administration and head maid. However, beneath her professional exterior lies a deep, passionate love for Light. While many of Light's female subordinates either adore him romantically or serve him with selfless devotion, Mei is firmly in the former group. She is incredibly skilled at maintaining her composure, so only those who know her extremely well are aware of her true feelings.\n\nBackground\nMei is the \"Level 9999 Seeker Maid,\" a powerful ally obtained from a SUR Card. She pledges absolute and unwavering loyalty to her master, Light. Within the organization known as the Abyss, she holds two of the most important positions. She serves as both the head of administration and the head maid, managing its internal affairs.\n\nStory\nEspionage Missions\n\nMei is the primary agent for missions that require operating outside the Abyss.\n\nHer human-like appearance makes her the perfect operative for espionage and intelligence gathering, as she can move through the outside world without drawing attention.\n\nAbilities\nDespite her high level, Mei is considered the weakest in pure combat power among the Level 9999s and lacks a decisive finishing blow. However, she makes up for this by being an extremely versatile jack-of-all-trades, capable of handling offense, defense, and support. In addition to her unique ability, she possesses a skill equivalent to \"Appraisal.\" She can also use a special magic that allows her to instantly determine if someone is lying.\n\nMagic String\n\nThis is Mei's signature ability, allowing her to create and manipulate threads woven from her own magic power. She has complete control over the strings, able to freely alter their softness, shape, material, and hardness to suit any situation. In battle, she primarily uses the strings to bind and restrain her opponents. The threads are deceptively lethal, possessing enough cutting power to slice a Level 1000 enemy into mincemeat. Their utility outside of combat is immense and varied. She can weave them into a thick rope to lift heavy objects, harden them to form a bathtub, or spread them into a thin dome to create a barrier.\n\nOther Skills:\n\nHeal\nSonar Detection\nSudden Death Attack Nullification\nMagic Manipulation\nTelepathy\n\nAdvertisement\nRelationships\nLight: Mei is completely devoted to Light, offering him absolute loyalty as his subordinate. Her loyalty, however, is fueled by a deep and hidden romantic love for him. She goes to great lengths to conceal the true nature of her affection. This professional mask ensures that her duties and her feelings remain separate in the eyes of others.\n\nTrivia\nDespite her incredible versatility and Level 9999 status, Mei is considered the weakest in terms of raw destructive power among her peers.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"h0dxpxmj1","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"esi6t3vos","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"l69kv5ab0","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"efhw8y92f","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"rx2v78gzm","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"fmelrww9z","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"f94gfz2fl","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"bkgqme9ab","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"kjmzhgn5w","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"otk2fcno4","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
