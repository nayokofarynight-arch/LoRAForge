She sacrificed her \"humanity\" to obtain her magical power. Even after being executed by the Hero of her time, her soul was able to endure, forcing the kingdom's mages to seal her in the pedestal underneath the sword where the soul of the Demon of Dark and Light was sealed.\n\nAppearance\nDamalynas has long dark hair and a big witch hat. Her clothes are very revealing. She clearly wears a g-string; though it's unknown if this Tsuya's underwear or what Damalynas altered them into.\n\nThe anime has Damalynas start off looking just like Tsuya upon the possession; she gradually darkness the skin and hair, the latter growing to her knees.\n\nPlot\nShe tempted the Blonde Hero to draw the sword, in which the soul of the Demon of Dark and Light Hiya was sealed. After her being released, she used Tsuya's body as her vessel. While in Tsuya's body, she changed her appearance into her original self and transformed the blonde hero into a Chimera. On top of this monster, she rushed to Howtau because there was the First Princess. Right before she could kill the Princess, Hiya stopped her and they fought. Damalynas used her trump card and enlarged the monster, but her magic got dispelled by Flio. This gave Hiya a chance and she used it to forcefully pull Damalynas out of Tsuya's body. After doing the same thing with the monster, Hiya pressed these two forces together and swallowed them. Because of that lived Damalynas' soul in Hiya's Inner World as Hiya's \"Training Partner\"/Lover.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"l2s1htqgu","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
