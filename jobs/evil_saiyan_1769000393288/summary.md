Appearance
Turles ES art
Turles in the Evil Saiyan state
This state lets the Saiyan generate a black and crimson red aura. It causes a noticeable increase in height and muscle mass, plus gives the Saiyan sterner and defined eyes. It also gives wilder hair reaching to the knees and a single forehead lock of hair.

Overall, the appearance is very similar to Super Saiyan 3, albeit with black hair typical of Saiyans in their base forms, and retaining their eyebrows.

Usage and Power
Cumber in this state originally proved to be able to fight on par with Super Saiyan Blue Vegito and later Super Saiyan 4 Xeno Vegito, though later he was shown needing to utilize this state alongside Super Saiyan 3 to battle the likes of Top or Super Saiyan Blue Goku. This state also gives the user an Evil Aura with a variety of special abilities.

Cumber utilizes this state throughout the entirety of his appearance.

Turles later gained this state after eating enough Fruit of the Tree of Might,[1] he utilized this state on the Pseudo Universe's Planet Vegeta to battle Vegeta and Cumber.

Enhancement

Video Game Appearances
Dragon Ball Heroes
This form appears in Dragon Ball Heroes, where it is used by Cumber and later Turles. Majin Ozotto uses this technique in Turles' form after absorbing him.

Trivia
In Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods it is said that the previous Super Saiyan God fought an army of Evil Saiyans (悪のサイヤ人, Aku no Saiya-jin), though it is unknown if they were all users of this form, or if they were simply villainous members of the Saiyan race.
Cumber's Evil Super Saiyan state hair remains the same in all three forms.
Turles is the first modern pure Saiyan shown to utilize the Evil Saiyan state.
