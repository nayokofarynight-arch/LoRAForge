For Goku, the aura is combined with his standard Super Saiyan aura and his body and hair gain an intense red hue. For Xeno Vegito, he retains his standard Super Saiyan appearance, with a less intense red hue compared to Goku and the Kaio-ken aura sparking around his Super Saiyan aura.\n\nUsage and Power\nSuper Kaio-ken Dragon Fist\nSuper Kaio-ken Goku's punches Pikkon into an asteroid\nGoku uses this technique while fighting in the Other World Tournament against Pikkon. By using the power of Kaio-ken after using Super Saiyan Full Power to amplify his power,[4] Goku gains a massive power increase. Goku is seen punching Pikkon towards an asteroid orbiting the Other World Stadium, after which he reverts to his Super Saiyan form.[5]\n\nVariations\nSuper Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken - Kaio-ken can be used alongside the Super Saiyan Blue form, with the anime showing the multiplier going up to x20.\nSuper Saiyan 4 Kaio-ken - In some video games the Super Saiyan 4 form has been combined with Kaio-ken as a power-up.\nSuper Kaio-ken Kamehameha - A combination of the Super Kaio-ken and Kamehameha used by Super Saiyan Goku in Dragon Ball Legends.\nVideo Game Appearances\nDragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle\nDragon Ball Heroes\nDragon Ball Legends\nSuper Dragon Ball Heroes: World Mission\nDragon Ball Super Divers\nIn Dragon Ball Z, Goku has the Kaio-ken as one of his special moves, and he is able to use it even in his Super Saiyan form.\n\nIn the Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game, Goku can use this Kaio-ken in combination with any of his appearing Super Saiyan forms: Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan Second Grade, Super Saiyan 2, Super Saiyan 3, as well as the Golden Great Ape form.\n\nIn Super Dragon Ball Z, Goku is able to use Super Kaio-ken by transforming into a Super Saiyan and then using Kaio-ken.\n\nIn Jump Super Stars, Goku can oddly use this in his Battle Koma 5 as his Special B/Up Special, being able to use it as a charged attack which increases the number of physical blows, he will perform in the brief combo for that one attack. It is used in the same fashion as the Super Kaio-ken (due to BK5 Goku being in Super Saiyan mode by default), only Goku simply has the red aura's outline with no actual change to his colors inside of said aura. It has been somewhat rectified in Jump Ultimate Stars, with Goku having his Battle Koma 5 being in his normal form instead.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Fusions, Goku can use the Maximum Kaio-ken in his playable Super Saiyan Blue form.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, the Future Warrior is able to utilize the Kaio-ken in conjunction with certain Awoken Skill transformations by using Kaio-ken based skills, though the effect is only visual and does not count as either a power-up or actual transformation. However, this effectively allows the Warrior to give the appearance they are using the technique.\n\nSuper Kaio-ken Dokkan artr\nBurning to the Last Super Saiyan Goku (Angel) (Super Kaioken) card in Dokkan Battle\nIn Dokkan Battle, Super Kaioken makes its official video game debut where Goku is a playable character in this form. Along with a few other Other World Saga characters, this Goku was initially unavailable on the Japanese version of the game and debuted as a Global exclusive, filling in the time slot for the Dragon Ball Heroes character batch on the Japanese version. Later, the cards would be added to the Japanese version with some slight statistical differences, though after Extreme Z-Awakening, both versions of Burning to the Last Super Saiyan Goku (Angel) (Super Kaioken) share the same Leader Skill, Super Attack and Passive Skill, only differentiated by one Link Skill.\n\nSuper Saiyan Kaioken\nSuper Saiyan Kaio-ken Xeno Vegito in Dragon Ball Heroes\nIn Dragon Ball Heroes, Xeno Vegito as Super Saiyan can use the Kaio-ken technique.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Legends, Goku is a playable unit in his Super Kaioken state as the Super Kaioken Goku (DBL24-13S) unit.\n\nIn World Mission, Xeno Vegito can utilize the technique which is localized as Super Saiyan Kaioken.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nTrivia\nXeno Vegito's variation of the Super Kaio-ken has a double aura, making it similar to the Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken.\nIt was mentioned by Old Kai in Dragon Ball Super that using Kaio-ken alongside Super Saiyan is almost impossible or rather lethal because the intense emotional turmoil caused by the Super Saiyan transformation would not allow precise ki control to survive the technique.\nIn Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, due to Kaio-ken being treated as a transformation, it cannot be combined with the Super Saiyan form. If the Kaio-ken is activated during Super Saiyan Goku's fights with Frieza on Namek during which his Super Saiyan form is his default form, then Goku will revert to base and power up with the Kaio-ken. He only transforms back into Super Saiyan if Goku deactivates the Kaio-ken.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"hbxfimjpd","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"cij2e1ud2","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"auao78tfo","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"jg9g7nwi5","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"bx0ngvmms","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"mnxlxufra","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"rn407kpxt","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"z4kfw57db","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
