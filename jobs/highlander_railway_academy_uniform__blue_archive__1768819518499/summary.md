Background
Highlander Railroad Academy is under the control of Saint Nephthys Company, a private company operating in Kivotos.[1] Asagiri Suou stated "We're one and the same at this point." when questioned about Nephthys Group buying the bonds related to the Trans-Desert Railroad in Abydos.[1]

Different regions and even individual railroad lines are under the control of different internal factions, which compete with each other, based off some sort of points system.[1][2] It is known to individuals outside of Highlander that the internal operations of the academy can become extremely political.[2]

Structure
The Central Control Center acts as the school's student council. In an unusual design, an organization oversees the student council, the Highlander Supervision Office, which reports to and carries out the wishes of a board of directors, likely at the Nephthys Group.[2][1]

General Information
Highlander Railroad Academy is a corporate academy which focuses on operating and maintaining Kivotos' railroad networks.[1] It can be said that most of the train services in Kivotos are under their control. They also excel in educating students about railroads and related topics.

Unlike territory-based schools which control individual districts and approach their governance from there, Highlander is a service-focused school, focusing their governance on individual rail corridors and the services that operate upon them. Additionally, the organizations within this school are all independent, but some are tasked to manage each other, such as the Highlander Supervision Office overseeing the Central Control Center.

In addition to railroad operations, the academy has other, unspecified, business ventures.[2]

Trivia
Some Highlander students are also employed by Nephthys Group.[3]
Following the events of Trip Trap Train, rumors about the violent might of Sensei, including blowing up an entire train, have started to spread among Highlander students.[4]
Despite having domain over railroads they own, Highlander is still obligated to cooperate with the academy or entity overseeing a district a railroad is passing through.[4]
Highlander Railroad Academy is the first academy in Blue Archive to be openly acknowledged as owned by a corporation, as well as the first one referred to as being a "corporate academy".[1]
Izayoi Nonomi was accepted to Highlander, but declined, to attend Abydos High School.[2]
Highlander Railroad Academy became the first school to be added as "playable" school in the game in 2025 after 3 years since the last school was introduced (Arius Branch School) in 2022, with Hikari, Nozomi, and Aoba becoming the first playable students from Highlander.
Furthermore, this is the only academy, excluding collaboration characters, where every playable character is limited.
Highlander's aesthetic is based on the American "Wild West" period, when railroad companies began expanding their businesses into newly-settled territories between the Mississippi River and West Coast at an incredible rate. Most students are equipped with weapons such as Winchester Model 1897 shotguns, Model 1873 rifles, and Colt Single-Action Army revolvers— all firearms that are commonly associated with the era.
Their primary freight locomotive appears to be a modified, 4-axle variant of the EMD SD70ACe-T4, an American-manufactured model. American locomotives are required to provide protection against .22LR rounds at minimum.
Inner Loop Line has the highest incident rate on the railway network.[5]
Highlander Railroad Academy itself loves Pizza, hence most likely confirmed to be Italians, hence the vibe from Italy, they don't like their pizzas flipped or damage, hence their disgust and disappointment during the Highlander Railroad Explosion Incident.
This would also mean that the Highlander Railroad Academy's main food dish is Pizza hence Pizza is the main cuisine of Central and Southern Italy.
Alongside Gehenna Academy and Arius Branch School, they are one of the few schools to not have any students with animal characteristics.
