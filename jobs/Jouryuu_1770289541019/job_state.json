A pair of antler-like horns sat atop her head. A pair of elongated ears, and black markings that cover her stomach.\n\nIt is noted that she is rather naked aside from the white armor that covers her abundant chest, waist, in addition to gauntlets and greaves.\n\nPersonality\nContrasting her fellow Rairashin, Joryu is rather stoic and less talkative, never speaking aside from when Shikoku is talking to her. She tends to agree with most of what Shikoku says, as opposed to Rairen.\n\nDespite her stoicness, Joryu is willing to humor her fellow Shuki's request, playing along with Shikoku's antics and helping out with her plans. In addition, Joryu cared for her fellow Hachiraishin as seen with her mourning Kusetsu's death and desire to avenge her. Joryu's love was strong enough to the point she willingly agree with Rairen's proposition, something she rarely does.\n\nBackground\n\n\nPlot\nPowers and Abilities\nAs one of the Eight Thunder Gods, Joryu is among the eight strongest residents of Mato, considered one of the \"Gods\" in Mato, a testament to this, she overpowered Shushu, Himari, Yachiho, Sahara, Aoba, Kidoumaru, and Kumadoji using a single attack from stomping her feet. She and the members also has supreme reign over all of the Shuuki who inhabits Mato.\n\nEarth Manipulation: Joryu has some degree of control over the power of \"earth\". She is able to conjure rocks at will to cover her body.\n\nHealing: Through the power of earth, Joryu is able to heal other people. Joryu and the subject must both be naked and in physical contact for the healing to take effect.\nPhysical Abilities\nImmense Strength: She has immense strength, remaining unaffected after Aoba tries to free herself, then tosses her aside using a single motion of her hand.[1] With her strength alone, she is capable of tearing apart and easily defeating Yuki's slave form enhanced by Ren Yamashiro.\n\nImmense Durability: Joryu is extremely durable. She is capable of taking head on attacks from Yuki's slave form and Ren Yamashiro, yet she remains relatively unscathed.\n\nEnhanced Reflexes: Joryu is able to react quicky against sneak attacks such as when Aoba tries to attack her from point-blank distance, she instantly tosses her away. She s\n\nFlight: Joryu is capable of flight, because of the white wings on her back.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"y0n4uleba","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"nqvmo0snw","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"44jv71wjg","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"z76pjlu3k","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"dkanv1f7o","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"wv6yspzso","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"zbwh9jzay","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
