She has dark and silver hair tied into twin ponytails which reaches the top of her thighs, pointed elfin ears, black bat-like wings and a black demon tail. She wears a lolita style black and red dress with pastel red stockings with white diamonds below her knees, and black boots decorated with red patterns.\n\nPersonality and traits\nIn contrast to Sylphy, Luceria is more blunt in her speech and mannerisms, openly demanding monster cores from Kaito in a rude tone, although she ascribes much of her rudeness to it being the way demons are and to take no notice of it. Despite which, she enjoys spending time with him, to the point where she will ask where he has been rather than being with her and Sylphy. When Kaito mentioned that he wanted to form a party with other adventurers, Luceria said there was no need to, and that the three of them were enough on their own. When Kaito showed off various items he purchased, she found flaws in them and soon pulled Sylphy away, who praised their master's choices. She acts very much like a tsundere around him and others, secretly enjoying the attention she gets. She questioned why Sylphy was known as 'Syl' and demanded a nickname of her own, and although she commented that 'Luce' was not creative, accepted it as one nonetheless. In combat, she mainly uses \"Hellfire of Destruction\", a flamethrower-like attack fired from her staff, and \"Corrosive Breath\", a poison mist attack that corrodes the target on contact. Upon levelling up sufficiently, she also gains access to \"Beauty of Gluttony\", a more powerful form where she can deal more damage. She becomes aware of her appeal in this form, and is more demanding of compliments from Kaito before undoing the bond. Following another level up, she was able to use Purgatory's Passion, a very powerful attack. When Bellia was added to the group, she was initially somewhat condescending to him, but soon warmed up to him too.\n\nSimilarly to Sylphy, she has a fear of bugs, although she will not admit to it.\n\nPlot\nIn the manga, when Luceria was first summoned she was shown as an adult with a very condescending and arrogant attitude. She was shown to be extremely powerful as she was able to match and eventually overwhelm Slyphy.\n\nWhen Slyphy touched the strange object that was protruding out of Luceria’s right eye, she saw the memories of her past. It was shown that she was looked down upon by the other demons in their world, and was bullied by other kids her age. Eventually, she was punished by their leader and was sealed in a tree, where she would remain until Kaito summoned her as his newest summon.\n\nLuceria was eventually taken down by Kaito and freed from her prison, allowing her revert to her child form and would help Kaito from then on.\n\nRelationships\nKaito Takagi\nUpon being summoned by Kaito, Luceria was quick to deride him as 'unreliable and dumb' for a master, and soon dubbed him a cheapskate for not giving her monster cores on demand. However, over time she grew closer to him, enjoying his company, although not admitting to it openly. On days when Kaito is unable to explore the dungeons, she will become jealous, and demand explanations to his whereabouts when next summoned. She requested that Kaito give her a nickname too, and accepted the name of 'Luce'. Upon assuming her adult form, she will become more flirtatious to him, and upon learning that her Beauty of Gluttony ability will weaken him, jokingly threatens to assume it. When Kaito was badly hurt from a sudden stampede, she panicked and slapped him, stating that she'd kill him herself if he died. Following Sylphy's example, she administered a potion to him mouth to mouth, and showed tremendous relief upon Kaito waking up, showing tears of joy that he was recovering.\n\nSylphy\nWhen the two first met, Sylphy was intimidated by the more forward and obnoxious demon, although the two quickly bonded to become close friends. Sylphy is usually the voice of reason for the two, talking Luceria down from demanding monster cores, although she will back her up when Kaito does not appear or breaks a promise to be in the dungeon on a certain day. The two have only grown closer, and gladly work together under Kaito's command.\n\nAiri, Hikari and Miku\nWhen Kaito's group was unable to defeat a dinosaur-like monster, he called out both Sylphy and Luceria to assist, and the monster was soon vanquished. The two girls were admired by Kaito's group, with Luceria receiving praise in particular from Hikari, who asked to stroke the demon girl's hair, a request she granted, albeit reluctantly. She seemed to be pleased by the trio calling her 'Lady' or 'Miss', and has no problems working with them. Upon learning of Hikari's illness, she was surprised and saddened, stating that it seemed hard to believe. When the group finally encountered a rare slime that dropped Titania's card, Luceria informed her that Titania was a healing familiar, and was visibly pleased upon Hikari including her as one of her heroes.\n\nBellia\nAfter defeating the demon knight, Luceria stated that he was 'the lowest of the lowly low', likely because her own rank as a viscount is considerably higher than his own. When Kaito mentioned the possibility of selling his card, Luceria eagerly agreed, inadvertantly prompting him to summon Bellia after all. Initially dismissive towards the fellow demon, she grew to show grudging respect that he was skilled with a weapon, and soon began to show more open friendship to him.\n\nAbilities and Powers\nAs a viscount class demon, Luceria is very powerful, able to handle many opponents with relative ease. Unlike Sylphy, Luceria uses a staff to fire her main attack, Hellfire of Destruction, a powerful flamethrower attack that can do impressive damage to most of her foes. In addition, she can use Corrosive Breath to literally corrode an enemy into sludge, an attack Kaito dubbed as terrifying. Upon levelling up sufficiently, she became able to use Beauty of Gluttony, absorbing Kaito's HP to bolster her own strength and assume an adult form temporarily. Reversing this bond is something she can do at will, although she seems to enjoy teasing Kaito with the threat of keeping it for longer. Following her second level up, she gained the ability Purgatory's Passion, coincidentally at the same time as Sylphy.\n\nHellfire of Destruction: is Luceria's standard attack. She summons a dark staff with a red gem in it to cast a powerful flamethrower-like attack that will harm any caught in its' way, and can presumably be used to alter the environment as well, as when she was on an ice floor with Kaito, Sylphy and Bellia, she suggested melting the ice away.\n\nCorrosive breath: is Luceria's second attack. A cloud of glowing red spots surrounds her and then engulfs her target, turning them to sludge. Kaito mentally noted the attack was terrifying to see, whereas Sylphy shuddered and soon covered her eyes, unable to watch.\n\nBeauty of Gluttony: is the first ability Luceria acquired upon levelling up. It is a last resort attack, draining the health of her master to bolster her own and regain her adult form temporarily. In this form she can use a powerful attack called God-Killer Duststorm, something her foe stated she should not be able to use.\n\nPurgatory's Passion: Luceria gains immense power, a glowing image of her older self shadowing her, as she flies at her foe and destroys them in a blaze of fire.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"anjp6njpk","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"84f5vukma","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"58lpjyrlz","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"elknqqezu","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"7zfefqayx","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"9hlky4h1i","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"7zrzwlj1r","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"rfc1k4pf7","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
