Background
Balirossa is a female knight from Klyrode, she graduated from a Knight Academy and is currently an adventurer. Until she met Flio and Rys, she was in a party with Blossom, Byleri and Belano. Her family was once noble but has lost their status.

Personality
Balirossa doesn't seem that worldly at first, seemingly having never experienced a fight against magic beasts; while training against a bear Flio used as her sparring partner, she stupidly believed it would obey the rules of chivalry.

She utterly fears Gholl the demon king, trying her damnedest to stay away from him; ironically her chivalry had endeared her to him when they first met. Balirossa once fainted with eyes open from just the shock of his demonic aura.

Balirossa is a bit selfish in wanting to regain nobility; becoming distraught that Blossom got the coveted title of dragon slayer, as that ALONE would qualify one for noble status. Ironically, she eventually accepts Gholl's affection and ends up married to the former demon king; Balirossa would become one of the queens when Gholl takes back the throne.

Appearance
She has long, blonde hair and light brown eyes. She wears knight armor consisting of blue and white elements.

Without her armor on, Balirossa has a bosom almost as big as Blossom. Heavily implying her armor was crafted to magically reduce her bust to lessen resistance and balance issues when in combat.

Plot
Volume 1
She got first introduced when Flio was in the Adventurer's Guild and wanted to help Rys, who at that time was still in the Dark Army. She and her party didn't believe that Flio can use spatial magic. They accompanied him and Rys to the Delaveza Forest where Rys tried to kill them and they apologized to Flio for not believing him at first. She and her party got saved by Flio, who sent them back via Teleportation magic. Later she and her party tried to kill a horde of Psychobears but they were on the verge of death because their opponents were too many and too strong. They got saved by Flio and Rys. After seeing their strength, they decided to follow Flio who accepted to become their instructor.

Volume 2
Due to Flio wanting to see her strength, she had to fight a Psychobear. She introduced herself to the bear and thought that it was obvious to do so, since it was chivalry. The bear didn't care and knocked her sword out of her hand and started to chase the scared Balirossa. After this session, they went home together. Their new home is a abandoned house near the place where the Psychobears showed up. After making Sybe a new place to sleep, they wanted to eat Rys's dinner and were shocked when they saw raw meat on the table. She and the others helped Flio with the cooking, after he decided to cook instead of Rys. After finishing cooking she enjoyed the food. She spent the next month training.

One day, she struggled killing a c-rank magic beast and Rys had to kill it for her, though it is likely, that she just faked it because she wanted to receive a magical support ring from Flio. After they went home, she was very surprised that Rys's cooking tasted that good. She and the other female knights were shocked and scared, after meeting Uliminas after dinner. They kept observing the conversation between Uliminas, Rys and Flio from far away. While Flio, Rys and Uliminas argued about the spar, she was on top of Sybe, who was in his Psychobear form, together with the other knights. She fainted after realizing who Flio killed (Fengaryl, one of the Infernal Four) and who Rys really was (Rys).

Several days later she witnesses Uliminas and the Dragon Riders appear in the sky. Later that day she was inside the house together with the other female knights. While the others talked about Blossoms new achievement, she didn't talk and left the room, saying that someone has to hunt monsters that day. Though, after leaving the room she was frustrated because she also wanted the Dragon Slayer title, since it could have restored the nobility of her family. While thinking of a way to get her family nobility back with the help of Flio, she notices a strange man looking at their house from afar.

After shortly observing him, she approached the man and asked him what he was doing here. He asked him if he was acquainted with Fenrys and the man said yes. Thus Balirossa knew that he was from the Dark Army and she drew her sword, asking what his business here was. After the Demon reassures her, that he does not want to make trouble, she puts down her sword and accepted his request to ask fenrys if he could meet with her. Before leaving he told her his name, which is Ghozal. The moment Ghozal left Flio and Fenrys ran up to her and asked if everything was all right. After hearing from Flio that she just pointed her sword at the Dark One himself she was shocked and thought that her live was over.

On another day, she just mined her business and suddenly entered Flio and Fenrys together with Ghozal. They sat down at the table, at which also Balirossa was sitting. What shocked her the most was, that Ghozal sat down besides her. She was so scared, that she just wanted to leave.

She sat besides him the whole time and said nothing. After Ghozal released his pressure, she fainted with her eyes open, which lead to a misunderstanding and Ghozal becoming even more interested in her.

Several weeks later she and the other knights were peeking outside of the window and all of them were shocked and scared., since outside stood several hundred soldiers and the Blonde Hero himself on a horse.

After hearing the Blonde Heros threats to Flio, she and the other knights raised their voice, saying that his behavior is awful, especially for someone who is supposed to be a hero. They had a harsh argument with him. After arguing with the hero, the hero made his horse kick Balirossa, luckily she was saved by Flio.

After Flio told Fenrys his intentions to leave this place, she asked him if he could take her and the other knights with him. She stated that when they were still little, they were told that Demons are bad creatures, though after meeting Fenrys they were convinced that this was not true. Thus, they began to question everything they were taught. At the end, she said that she wouldn't serve this kingdom. She was teleported away by Flio together with the other knights, Fenrys, and their whole propriety.

Volume 3+
Balirossa felt bad about still mooching off of Flio. She went with him and Rys to sell thier wares only for Hiya to attack. She saw Rys' death, Flio rewinding time and then Hiya's beatdown. Balirossa then helped calm down Blossom, Byleri and Belano when Hiya was introduced to the household.
