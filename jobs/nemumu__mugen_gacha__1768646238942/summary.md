Appearance
She is a beautiful girl with long silver hair and striking, blood-red eyes. Despite her short stature, she is noted for having a large bust. She is typically seen wearing a set of heavy, imposing armor. When she enters combat, her pupils eerily elongate into vertical slits.

Personality
A cheerful, carefree demeanor with a childlike charm that no one can resist. She wishes to be useful, and becomes emotional when she isn't called upon or forgotten about. She also struggles with holding back in the slightest, knocking out Hardy, twice.

Due to being the last of the four SUR summons, everyone treats her like the their youngest child. Except for Yume, and becomes excited at the idea of being treated as an "big sister".

Background
Nazuna is a powerful being who serves as the ultimate trump card for Light's kingdom within the Abyss. She has wielded her signature weapon, the Greatsword Prometheus, since the very moment she first came into existence.

Story
The Strongest Knight of the Abyss

Nazuna holds the title of the strongest warrior in Light's kingdom, located in the Abyss. Her role is that of the ultimate fighting force, a powerhouse so overwhelming that even formidable fighters like Ellie and Aoyuki must combine their efforts to challenge her, while others like Mei wouldn't dare.

A Teacher of Instinct

Her mastery of combat is so innate that it cannot be taught through conventional means. This was proven when Light attempted to learn weapon skills from her, only to be met with abstract, feeling-based instructions that he couldn't comprehend, forcing him to abandon the training.

Abilities
Overwhelming Strength

As the "Level 9999 True Ancestor Vampire Knight," Nazuna is the strongest fighter in the Abyss.

Her power is so immense that it would take both Ellie and Aoyuki fighting together just to stand a chance against her.

In a testament to her strength, their companion Mei voluntarily withdraws from battle, knowing she would only be a liability.

Martial Prowess

While she favors her greatsword, Nazuna is a master of all forms of combat and can expertly wield nearly any weapon.

However, her fighting style is purely intuitive and abstract.

When Light once asked her to teach him swordsmanship, he had to give up because her explanations were too conceptual to understand.

Weaknesses

Despite her incredible power, she has a slightly low resistance to magical attacks.

Her greatest weakness is her tendency to rely on brute force rather than strategy.

Greatsword Prometheus

This Mythical-grade greatsword is Nazuna's primary weapon and the source of her most fearsome abilities.

• Reality Warping

By uttering the command, "Twist the Providence," Nazuna can rewrite the laws of the world to match her will.

This allows for impossible feats, such as instantly healing from fatal wounds or creating multiple duplicates of herself with the same level and equipment.

• Limitations

The sword's power is most effective with the least backlash when used on herself.

The further the effect is from her, the weaker it becomes and the greater the risk.

Attempting to directly weaken an opponent, for example, yields minimal results and can trigger a backlash powerful enough to kill the user.

There is also a capacity limit; she can only create up to four perfect clones.

Beyond that, their quality drops, though she can create up to 1000 lesser versions if she forgoes quality.

Relationships
Nazuna is a key member of Light's forces in the Abyss and is completely adored by its other inhabitants.

Her power is often used as a benchmark to measure the strength of others, such as Ellie and Aoyuki.

Equipment
Mythology-Class - Greatsword Prometheus: Able to create up to 4 clones of the wielder and itself, each possessing identical stats and abilities of the original. Furthermore, as a Mythology-class weapon, it is capable of interfering with the world's logic and rewrite anything the wielder wishes to rewrite (Limited only to the sword and the wielder).

Trivia
Despite being called a Vampire Knight, Nazuna has no idea what a vampire actually is.
She firmly believes blood is not for drinking.
She loves garlic because the smell makes her hungry and enjoys sunbathing, thinking it's good for her health.
She is also completely immune to holy magic, simply stating it's because she's "invincible."
She is notoriously careless with her priceless Greatsword Prometheus. She has been known to use it as a beach shovel, handle it with sticky hands after eating snacks, and even use it like a saw to cut through walls.
