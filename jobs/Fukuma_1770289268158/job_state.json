After her defeat by members of the Anti-Demon Corps 8th Unit in Shangri-La, she resides in Yuuki Wakura's spirit world.\n\nContents\n1\tAppearance\n2\tPersonality\n3\tSynopsis\n3.1\tMeeting of the Thunder Gods\n3.2\tInfiltration\n3.3\tBattle of Shangri-La\n4\tPowers and Abilities\n4.1\tOverview\n4.2\tShuuki Powers\n4.3\tTechniques\n5\tTrivia\n6\tReferences\nlogo\n00:02\n\n41:20\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\nAs a shapeshifter, Fukuma's actual appearance is unknown and she assumes the forms of multiple women, often the inversion of their skin tone, hair color, and clothing. However, she is capable of matching their skin tone and color when pretending to be them.\n\nAlthough Fukuma does not have a physical appearance of her own, she likes to adopt the form and physical attire of Ren Yamashiro, with an inverted appearance; pink hair, tanned skin, white clothes with purple highlights, and green a cape with a white background, among other details, which differentiate her from the real Ren.\n\nPersonality\nLike the other members of the Eight Thunder God, Fukuma looks down on and underestimates humans, believing herself to be superior to their species. She, in particular, has a high amount of confidence in her abilities, which allows her to assume the form of others among the Anti-Demon Corps. Despite this, Fukuma takes her responsibilities seriously, spying and learning about the people whose identities she assumes in an attempt to deceive their allies. Although she is an opportunist, she is perceptive enough to realize when a plan won't work in her favor in the end.\n\nHowever, as the second youngest member, Fukuma can often be childish and has a habit of lashing out when things don't go the way she intends, as shown in her fight with Varvara.\n\nSynopsis\nMeeting of the Thunder Gods\nTBA\n\nInfiltration\nTBA\n\nBattle of Shangri-La\nTBA\n\n\nAdvertisement\nPowers and Abilities\nOverview\nAs one of the Eight Thunder Gods, Fukuma is one of the eight strongest Shuuki, considered one of the \"Gods\" in Mato. As a testament to this, she would have killed most of the members of the 7th and 8th Unit had Himari not rewound back time.\n\nShuuki Powers\nShapeshifting: Her main ability appears to be altering and changing her appearance at will, assuming the exact form of people, to the point of having their clothing. For an unknown reason, Fukuma most often assumes the form of Ren, but has taken the form of Varvara, Bell, and Kyouka. Most often, her transformations are imperfect, in that the colors she assumes are the originals' negative contrasts. For example, whereas Ren has light skin and black hair, Fukuma has dark skin and light hair. However, as shown when she neutralized Bell, she can match their skin tone and hair color, becoming a perfect replica of the original. This, however, isn't perfect, as Yuuki noted her body and skin feels different from the original. In addition to this, she has full command of her bodily shape and volume, essentially being able to change herself into anything she wants. She is also capable of reducing her size, turning her body into a minuscule figure to evade any attacks that come her way.\n\nPhase-shifting: Her defensive ability in which she can alter the matter of her body, turning it into liquid-like substance which quickly adapts to any form of attacks that penetrate her.\nWeapon Creation: She can alter the shape of her body and turn it into deadly weapons like blades, easily slicing through the bodies of her opponents.\nCloning: Fukuma can create copies of herself to fight in her stead, through a process almost similar to fission, which reduces her actual strength, but the clones are powerful enough to overwhelm the boosted members of the 8th Unit. The clones are small, the size of a 10-year-old girl, but they can cause enormous damage and can act almost independently of the original body. So far, Fukuma can only create 2 clones of herself.\nElectricity Manipulation: She can unleash a powerful electricity from her Halo.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Fukuma possesses considerable strength, capable of piercing through Bell Tsukiyono's chest without any effort.\n\nImmense Endurance: Befitting her status as a Thunder God, Fukuma has shown astonishing resiliency. She remains unaffected after being hit with deadly blows from Varvara in which the latter is shocked of how formidable the God is.\n\nTransformation: Like the other Thunder Gods, Fukuma is evidently capable of transforming into a significantly stronger \"Full Power\" form. However, Fukuma requires her body to be free in order to transform, as seen in her battle with Varvara where she was unable to transform due to most of her body being frozen, which ultimately led to her defeat.\n\nDream/Memory Manipulation: Some time before her death, when Yuuki accidentally absorbed a portion of Fukuma's essence when they kissed, she managed to enter Yuuki's spirit world after his death. Later, she learned the ability, like Kuusetsu, to see Yuuki's memories, manipulate and talk to him in his dreams, exercise some of his powers, and know what Yuuki is doing when awake.[1][2] Like Kuusetsu and Rairen, Fukuma cannot escape or harm Yuuki, in the spiritual world, as she does not have a physical body.[3]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nTechniques\nDivine Messenger Transformation: A technique in which she breaks off larges pieces of herself, manifesting them in the shape of various animals (specifically a deer, an octopus, a bird, and a fox). These animal-like extensions of her can then attack her opponent. In her battle against Varvara, this was mainly used as a diversionary tactic.\n\nDivine Weapon Transformation - Ame-no-Nuboko: A technique in which Fukuma transforms herself into a giant spear and launches herself at her opponent. This technique is very powerful as it did considerable damage to Varvara's Kyouka statue within her Paladin realm.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"biwlbzyqg","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"zg9qdr8zq","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"kt6xyqmuy","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"tfi1nh321","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"xadg163yl","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"my10ybmur","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
