She is working with Momoka Sagara and D5.\n\n\nAppearance\nE9 has short orange hair with long bangs that reach and, often, appear to cover her eyes, and ties some of her hair up in two short side pigtails. She wears a skimpy undersized green and yellow uniform with a pink ribbon on her chest. The uniform exposes her underboob, her belly and her thighs/legs. She is somewhat plump, underlined by her belly spilling over her skirt while creating a muffin-top gut.\n\nPersonality\nShe is an easygoing, mysterious, obedient and airhead Soldier Arm. Her favorite kink is the tingling of nipples, such as when she touches some of the girls to scan and detect the Extar whom activated the Valkyrie Effect, she stated that she'll tingle them a little bit for the Drive; and during episode 11, she was taught a stiff lesson by the Gouverneur Charlotte, with sharing a french kiss, and her breasts to be jiggled and her nipples pulled to enter the needed Drive to capture Mirei as requested by the organization.\n\nShe apparently is in love with Momoka the most out of all girls, was satisfied with blushed cheeks and her hands placed on her chest for witnessing Momoka's sadistic side in her saying the purpose of her actions. Without the requisition to be physically close to Momoka in order to Drive, she accomplished her Drive as ordered by her while being distant from her.\n\nStory\nTBA\n\nPowers and Abilities\nTBA\n\nGallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\nMore Information\nComments (4)\nJoin the conversation\nSign in to read what others are saying and share your thoughts.\nSIGN IN\nDon't have account?
