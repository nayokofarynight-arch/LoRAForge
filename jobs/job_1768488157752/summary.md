An elf-girl summoner mage that became Kail's lover in the original timeline. 
Upon seeing her again in the new timeline, Kail screws up, and calls Urza by her true name despite elves only revealing it to their loved ones. They decide to create a partial contract that would result in Kail dying if he continues to misuse her name, but can only be done on a full moon, which, due to Kail being in a hurry, forces her to follow along on his journey. However, even after the contract was created, she decides to stick with the group anyway.
