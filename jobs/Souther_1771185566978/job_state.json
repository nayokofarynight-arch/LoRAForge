He fights with clawed gloves à la Freddy Krueger (although the three blades on the back more closely resemble Wolverine's claws), and has an invulnerable anti-air counterattack, making jumping assaults very risky against him.\n\nStreets of Rage 2\nThough Souther himself doesn't appear in the game, a palette swap of Zamza with his name functions as the co-boss of stage 6, accompanied by Stealth.\n\nStreets of Rage 4\nThe SOR1 version of Souther appears in Mania+ inside a cursed arcade during stage 10. He can also be fought during the games survival mode.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"d3fwa6zpn","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"esxr4fp82","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"a0wtdhmlp","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"1wm3n8n8k","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"d95jcm9vx","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"4nqlxde5v","mimeType":"image/webp"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
