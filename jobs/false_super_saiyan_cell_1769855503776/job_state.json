In the anime Daizenshuu, this form was originally labeled as the true Super Saiyan form, but later re-labeled as Giji or \"False\" Super Saiyan after the actual Super Saiyan form was introduced in the manga series.\n\n\nContents\n\n1\tAppearance\n2\tUsage\n3\tTrivia\n4\tSite Navigation\n1/2\n\n\n\n\nThe video player is currently playing an ad.

This ultimate pain was not fully present during the fight against Slug, that and Goku wasn't at the same power level as when he fought Frieza, which is most likely why Goku did not transform fully. The form of False Super Saiyan was shown to be very erratic, lasting for only as long as the aura is ignited, and using up much more energy to sustain than the full Super Saiyan.\n\nUsage\nFalse Super Saiyan Goku triumphs over Lord Slug\nFalse Super Saiyan Goku triumphs over Lord Slug\n\nDuring the battle against Lord Slug, Goku's strength began to quickly debilitate. Having no more options, Goku's anger surged, causing him to gain a massive power increase, enough to quickly overwhelm Slug. However, after a quick sequence of thrashing Slug around, Goku's False Super Saiyan power quickly faded.\n\nOne way to put it is that the False Super Saiyan transformation occurs when a Saiyan has the required physical power but lacks the required mental strife to transform into a Super Saiyan. It is apparent, however, that the form gives a large power increase, enough for Goku, who was being easily beaten previously by Slug, to now quickly overwhelm him.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nTrivia\nKing Kai said this transformation is the Super Saiyan transformation.\nA popular misconception among fans is that Future Trunks once achieved the False Super Saiyan state due to the similar appearance of the state he took in both the Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks TV Special, and just before fighting Frieza. However, Daizenshuu 7 only list Goku as a user of this transformation, even though both Gohan and Future Trunks display similar characteristics of the form in the anime.\nA similar misconception involves Goku's \"semi-Super Saiyan\" state during the filler anime episode, \"Warriors of the Dead\". In this case, however, it was a last-minute decision to keep Goku's Super Saiyan powers hidden from Pikkon rather than a simple coincidence, thus his hair was digitally altered from gold to black and his eyes from green to black. (In the original Japanese promo for the episode, Goku's hair turns gold and eyes turn green.) The aura was oddly untouched.\nBroly also displays a similar form in Paragus' first flashback sequence during the movie Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan; in which a teenage Broly is running amok, destroying planets unrestrained. The form's hair stands up on end like Broly's Super Saiyan form and has the same reddish tint to the hair as Goku's False Super Saiyan form, however his eyes retain their pupils. Also, Broly exhibited a similar transformation when escaping the destruction of Planet Vegeta due to his eyes going blank.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"0woencrde","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
