You don't have talent for dragon hunting, Ragna. I'm a genius, so I would know. But this genius had a burst of intuition then, that one day you would be so much stronger. When that will happen... and what will bring it about... I can't say. I couldn't even begin to guess, but... I can't wait! So you don't have to rush. I'll be here to protect you until that time comes, Ragna.

Appearance
Leonica is a young girl who is shown to be shorter than Ragna. She has pink short hair and a fish tail on the left side of her head ending with a silver cross like accessory. On her face is present a large scar crossing her face from the bottom right of the face to the top left. The color of her eyes is green. Her appearance as a young weak girl deceives her true strength which is beyond most of the dragon hunters. She usually wears a white dress with a red ribbon and shorts. When hunting she wears long boots reaching above her knees and a winter overcoat too. Above them she wears a chest plate and a set of armored shoulders, forearms, gloves and feet. On her back is placed her oversized silver sword.

Personality
Leonica is ever joyful and lives without care probably a consequence of her strength. She puts Ragna at the utmost importance as he's the dearest person she knows of and the only one who always was with her since young age thus she always keeping safe Ragna when hunting and living without him is such unknown concept she finds it impossible. The rare cases she's angry is when Ragna is hurt, she shows unstoppable killing intent.

Even though she's one of the most able Dragon Hunters and the one defending Ragna, Leonica is still just a child and will often throw tantrums whenever Ragna wants to leave her behind.

Biography
Background
Leo saving Ragna from his bullies.
Leo saving Ragna from his bullies.

Leonica since the first sword she used in very early age realized she sought strength and so she hunted dragons. One day she found Ragna getting kicked around because people believed he was affected by a curse that wherever he went death and destruction followed but he always survived. Leonica saved him and even against his protest of warning her of his curse she explained him that those who die are only the weak and those stronger than a dragon survive, and she could prove it to him. Since then they traveled together hunting dragons.

Fall of the Kingdom of Lese

Leonica scolds Ragna.

Leonica saved Ragna from a dragon attack while they were hunting and scolded him to not get distracted again. They waited sunrise for the sunlight to ignite a pile of dragons hunted by them and then they returned to the Guild HQ of the city of Ronabera to redeem the reward for their hunt. Later that day Leonica and Ragna were lunching at the Guild's tavern when from a nearby table Sykes Charluke, the 2nd ranked dragon hunter of the city, started troubling Ragna by reminding him he was a weak hunter and would only slow down Leonica the prodigy.

She intervened with a drawn sword in the discussion and asked Sykes what he sought with his silver sword and then she turned towards the whole tavern explaining she was seeking the ultimate power and to reach it she hunted the strongest living creatures, the dragons. She questioned if anyone was interested to follow her in her journey, she would split with anyone all the wealth, status and glory in exchange of a life of hunting dragons but to her not surprise only Ragna came forward, she paid the lunch and they went to their room.

Five days later the hunters in the guild noticed the weird movement of the dragons and realized they were moving towards Donapierru also known as "The city who needs no dragon hunter" because it was never attacked by dragons in the last 20 years. Leonica remembered that in Donapierru was located the famous cake shop "The Silver Chick" and suggested that if the dragons were nearby the city they could make a visit there but she realized Ragna wasn't listening to her anymore. Leonica got back Ragna's attention and asked him what was wrong as she noticed his tiredness and hands state, he was working more than usual. Ragna asked to Leonica how he could be useful beyond taking care of her but she revealed him the first time she saw him she realized he had her same potential. She admitted it was true he didn't have talent but her genious intuition told her the day he becomes stronger will come, she didn't know where or when but until then she assured him she will be there protecting him. Ragna succumbed to his tiredness and fell asleep between Leonica's arms.

The evening of the day after, February 27th, the news of the fall of Donapierru reached Ronabera. The city was attacked by dragons just after sunset and the Kingdom issued an emergency quest to hunt down the dragons. The hunters of the city were in disarray while Ragna tried to warn Leonica of something but he got interrupted when the dragons attacked Ronabera too. As the defense got overwhelmed by the swarm of dragons Ragna ambushed an unknown individual leading the attack but he failed and he got thrown in the city's river by his target's counterattack. Leonica after slaying a medium dragon in one move screamed to Sykes, who saw everything, to save Ragna still alive but drowning in the river unconscious while she dealt with the unknown threat.

Leonica, exhausted, survived several attacks but she realized it was impossible to get beyond the threat's defenses and for her curiosity she questioned him if he was the rumored Dragon God. The statement enraged him and forced him to introduce himself: Grymwelte the 10th rank of the Winged Bloodline, at the bottom rank of the dragons called "superior dragons" by the humans.

To satisfy her curiosity Grymwelte revealed the reason of the attack was because the cake shop named "Silver Chick" which the Dragon God enjoyed its product went out of business recently, in other words the fall of the Kingdom was decided by the Dragon God's whim. Grymwelte proceeded to kill Leonica but he stopped when he felt a sudden threat, Ragna now different from before easily killed the dragons on his path. Grymwelte felt threatened more than ever and decided to transform in his dragon form but it was useless as Ragna killed him with a single touch. Ragna seeing Leonica alive broke down crying and fell asleep between her arms.[1]

Leonica woke up the day after and surprisingly found Ragna already up discussing with Sykes, Ragna seeing Leonica broke down crying and fell asleep again. Sykes noted it was dawn but he got surprised when he saw a never seen before forest in the outskirt of the city, he and Leonica quickly moved to the highest point of Sykes's manor to observe it and Leonica pointed out her genius instincts told her it was something dangerous but Sykes added there was no need to be a genius to figure it out. Soon after the forest proved to be a threat and started attacking the survivors, many trees approached the manor too and when Sykes hit one of them it freezed and they realized they were dragons in nature. After Leonica cut down several of them the trees crushed the manor and grabbed the sleeping Ragna, Leonica tried to save him and screamed his name which woke up him. Ragna released a silver aura blast and freezed all the nearby trees in a instant and run away towards the center of the forest. Leonica tried to follow him but he was too quick for her. When she finally reached him she noted he already defeated the culprit as she was approaching the trees started to fall on their own. She recognized Ragna had finally become stronger just as her genius instinct told her before even though she didn't expect so soon.

Ragna asked her a favor to take the survivors and cross the border but she immediately refused as she didn't want to leave Ragna side even against his warnings. She started a childish tantrum leaving Ragna without words so he reminded her of what she told him long time ago that those who die are only the weak and those stronger than a dragon survive. Those words saved him and he was glad he met her but now she was weak and if she stayed with him she would die. She attacked him in desperate attempt but she got knocked out in one hit by him. Shortly after she was found by Sykes who woke up her and asked her what happened and where Ragna was, she admitted she tried to hit him knowing she would never land a hit because she recognized in him the strength she sought but she still couldn't accept he left her and so she broke down crying.[2]

Survivors Aftermath

Leonica woke up 2 weeks after the departure of Ragna, she was traumatized and fell asleep for so long as a form of mental escape to protect her mind. Sykes found Leo scavenging the kitchen but when she noticed him she pretended nothing happened and returned to her room. Sykes followed and found Leonica pretending she just woke up from the trauma, Sykes yelled her since when she woke up and she calmly replied it didn't pass much time and to her subsequent question she learned she was resting in one of the countless manors of the Sykes family in Garness.

After she discovered how much she slept she wasn't surprised as she knows her habits but she shortly after assured him with a joyful smile she was back. Sykes relieved stated he wasn't worried about her he was just annoyed, to his reply then Leo asked if he could get her some food as she was still hungry and Sykes yelled he was even more annoyed now.[3]

Sykes decided to show to Leo the encampment of the survivors which were so numerous that they couldn't have been housed in the city they were resting in. Sykes tries to dismiss the survivors as he already has done enough work for them but Leo agrees with him to his surprise, Leo realized Sykes was trying to get punished by her because he was feeling guilty of not being able to take good care of them. Sykes then asked then why she helped Ragna back then when she met him the first time, Leo confused realized the ones beating Ragna were Sykes and his group. Leo hit Sykes with an upper cut causing him a concussion, Leo still hungry stole Sykes wallet while his goons where trying to comfort him. Leo thanked Sykes of taking care of her which caused Sykes to recover immediately as he was annoyed that she thanked him only now and scolded Leo to give him back the wallet to her delusion. Leo asked Sykes which way was the Kingdom of Lese and he pointed it out, Sykes asked her if she intended to go back but she assured him she would not as she always believed in strength and she now was weak.[4]

Attack on the Survivors
The survivors were attacked by the winged bloodline but they were defeated by Leo and Sykes. Gilzea investigated Leo which resulted in unconsciousness or death of all people present there by her sheer aura. Leo and Sykes decided to follow Gilzea to become stronger.[5]
