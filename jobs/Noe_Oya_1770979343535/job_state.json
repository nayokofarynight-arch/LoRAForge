Previously they were a softball battery pair for their school's softball team, before they were taken away and sent to the island for quarantine.\n\nPowers & Abilities\nNinjutsu: Noe seemed to have used this ability on cooking a chili-flavored yakisoba for a few seconds. It is unknown if she can use this ability in battle despite being a Liberator.\nEtymology\nThe name Noe means \"from\" (乃) (no) and \"picture, painting\" (絵) (e).\nNoe's surname Oya means \"big, great\" (大) (o) and \"roof, house, shop, dealer, seller\" (屋) (ya).\nTrivia\nIt is hinted that Noe was presumably a kunoichi from an unknown organization or school before she met Nimi since on her childhood, hence the reason why she was behind bars due to an unseen action from the past that brought harm to others.\nIf she were a combatant in-universe, Noe's motif might be a Ninja, with her overall characteristics are based on ninja-themed Kamen Riders: Rentaro Kagura (A.K.A., Kamen Rider Shinobi), Isamichi Konjo (A.K.A., Kamen Rider Hattari) and Ren Akamichi (A.K.A., Kamen Rider Kenzan).","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"kjv6cdnze","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"v130vlg8b","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"mjibbjtyy","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"kih3u2s73","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
