They ran away from home to escape this. She typically fights with magic from the back but is capable of fighting with a sword.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAppearance\nLily has the same face and hair color as her twin sister Lilia, the only difference being that she has red eyes while her sisters’ is blue, she also keeps her hair down while her sister ties it up into a ponytail. They also wear the same type of clothing that was provided to them by the guild, the only difference being that the gem on their neckwear matches their eye color.\n\nWhen Lily and Lilia combine, her sister Lilia takes control which is why when they fuse her sister’s appearance remains. However during their battle against Amon, Lily for the first time took control and as a result her appearance remained instead as her sister was unconscious. When merged Lily’s appearance remains the same except like her sister, she has one red eye and one blue eye as she and her sister have different eye colors.\n\nPersonality\nShe is a kind young woman who is quite attached to her sister. She strives to better herself in order to be able to be independent as she doesn't want to continue burdening her sister forever. While she can be quite clumsy she is quite intelligent, being capable of directing Rud and the others when they were striving to conquer the Keild Labyrinth. According Lilia, Lily has problems dealing with men, although she has no problem when it comes to conversing with Rud showing that she trusts him.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAbilities/Skills\nDungeon Walk: allows the user to travel to and from floors they have already visited. Can only affect six people at a time.\nFusion: A skill that when used causes Lily and her twin Lilia to fuse into a single form named Lilialy. Most of the time when they fuse Lilia takes control of Lilialy, but during the battle against Amon, Lily for the first time took control of their merged form.\nMulti-Element Blade: When Lily took control of Lilialy for the first time, she was struggling until Rud told her to fight her own way. As a result she created the multi element blade, which involves her imbuing her sword with four elements (Wind, Water, Earth, & Fire) all at once. Which allows her to unleash a powerful blow, she used this skill against Amon and beat her with one blow.\nIce Magic","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"vkbaqf6vz","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"2aueyh4mh","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"vlaqviu6e","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
