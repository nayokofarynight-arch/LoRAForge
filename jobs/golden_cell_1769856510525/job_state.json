It was first created and named by Frieza himself. This transformation is achieved by Frieza through vigorous training methods due to his obsessive need for revenge against Goku, as Frieza is a natural prodigy in terms of power, he never trained prior to his endeavor to defeat Goku.\n\nUnlike the other forms that are able to be used constantly and are for power-suppression, this form is an acquired, non-permanent transformation used to power up.\n\n\nContents\n1\tOverview\n1.1\tAppearance\n1.2\tUsage and Power\n1.3\tDrawbacks\n2\tAdvancements\n3\tVariations\n4\tFilm Appearances\n5\tVideo Game Appearances\n6\tTrivia\n7\tGallery\n8\tReferences\n9\tSite Navigation\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat training methods did Frieza use to achieve his Golden form?toggle section\nWhat is the significance of the 'Golden Frieza' transformation in the Dragon Ball Z series?toggle section\nWhat is the meaning of 'this is golden frieza the last thing you'll see'?toggle section\nHow does the Golden Frieza form differ from Frieza's other forms?toggle section\nWho first created and named the 'Golden Frieza' transformation?toggle section\nOverview\nAppearance\nGolden Frieza as drawn by Akira Toriyama\nGolden Frieza as drawn by Akira Toriyama\n\nWhile in this form, the user becomes several inches taller, as seen when Frieza transforms and he grows from his normal height of about 158cm/5'2\" and becomes a few inches taller. How much Frieza grows is a bit inconsistent, but in Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ he becomes about as tall as Goku who is 175cm/5'9\". The brow ridges become visibly pronounced, the gem plates on the arms and legs shrink, skin turns purple with their biological armor changing color, in Frieza's case gaining a glimmering golden shine; also, if the Frieza clan user's natural eye color is different, and they assume this form, they turn blood red, like Frieza's. It is implied that the user can choose what color they want their biological armor to take when they use their Golden form, as Frieza mentioned that he \"made it gold\", although every user of the form thus far has been shown with a gold coloration. The muscle mass of the user is larger than Frieza's true form. When unleashing ki from their body, the user generates an opaque flame-like aura somewhat similar to the aura of Super Saiyan Blue.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nUsage and Power\n\"Of course I hope you realize this iteration has far more to it than a shimmering new facade.\"\n— Frieza anticipating the power of his Golden Form.\n\nFrieza unleashing the Golden Frieza's aura\nFrieza unleashing the Golden Frieza's aura\n\nAs Golden Frieza, Frieza is extremely powerful and one of the most powerful in Universe 7, being initially superior to Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan Blue forms separately, to the point that Goku was nervous about fighting him, as Vegeta was as well - until his weakness was discovered. The January 2017 V-Jump article on the rivals appearing in Dragon Ball Super noted that Golden Frieza's strength surpasses Super Saiyan Blue, it also ranks Golden Frieza as an eight out of twelve on the danger scale.[10]\n\nIn the manga, after his image training it is said by Frieza that getting serious as Golden Frieza he would be more than capable of handling Super Saiyan Kale, and later Golden Frieza (without using his full power) managed to briefly hold his own against Jiren - to which Beerus briefly considered the possibility that Frieza could turn the fight around, despite having seen Jiren easily defeat Super Saiyan God SS Evolved Vegeta.\n\nBy the time of Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Golden Frieza had become strong enough to push Super Saiyan Broly back while transforming and proceeded to hold his own for one hour, with the novel adding that Golden Frieza's punches could stagger Broly and his full power blows forced the Super Saiyan to dodge.\n\nGolden Frieza in Dragon Ball Super\nGolden Frieza in Dragon Ball Super\n\nWhen Golden Frieza was at his full power in this state, Super Saiyan Blue Goku was barely able to land any blows, and only while catching Frieza off-guard. Vegeta was nervous to face him as well (despite having the same power as Goku). It was not until Golden Frieza's power dropped considerably that Super Saiyan Blue Goku had the advantage. However, even with the evolution's tremendous power, Frieza did not seem to want to face Beerus, worrying if the God of Destruction were to interfere with his revenge, he wouldn't be able to stop him. The form gained open acknowledgment by even God of Destruction Beerus and his attendant Whis from Frieza's tremendous growth in power, and in the anime, Goku notes that if Frieza fought seriously he could have potentially killed Goku in an instant. However, this is revealed to be untrue when Goku used his full power in the anime and Frieza decides to use his full power as well, still holding a slight edge against Goku.\n\n\"Episode 26\" and Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle both reference Golden Frieza as having \"power beyond imagination\". Dragon Ball Heroes also states that Golden Frieza's power is unmatched.\n\nGolden Frieza vs\nGolden Frieza vs. Super Saiyan Blue Goku\n\nFrieza attained this form at some point during his training in preparation for his invasion of Earth, his training unleashing his immense dormant power and also igniting this heightened power from within him.[11] Immediately after attaining this evolution Frieza headed to Earth in order to have his revenge, instead of attempting to first master the form. During his battle against Goku, Frieza transforms into this form in order to show off his power in comparison to Goku's own transformation into a Super Saiyan Blue.\n\nAfter Frieza's battle with Goku finishes, Frieza continues the fight in his Golden Form when fighting Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta; however, at the end of the fight, he drops out of it, due to his stamina becoming too low for him to sustain the form. Additionally, during the battle Frieza briefly managed to take on a Fury mode; however, he had lost too much power and stamina and so collapsed to the ground.\n\nGolden Frieza\nGolden Frieza\n\nIn the manga, Frieza utilized his Golden Frieza form in the Tournament of Power in order to easily overwhelm Super Saiyan Caulifla, Kale and Super Saiyan Cabba. Towards the end of the tournament, Frieza becomes Golden Frieza once more after Vegeta has been taken down by Jiren in order to battle the God of Destruction-like foe, briefly holding his own before being outmatched and needing 17's assistance.\n\nIn the anime, when Goku came to recruit Frieza to become a part of Team Universe 7 for the Tournament of Power, the tyrant transformed into this form to remind Goku of his potential for even further growth, so that Goku would be tempted to give in to Frieza's request to be revived after the tournament, which was Frieza's primary condition for entering the tournament. Frieza would use the form yet again in preparation to battle Universe 9's Assassins, before revealing the \"true Golden Frieza\" state, which Frieza would go on to use for the rest of the saga in battles against Gohan, Cabba, Agnilasa, Dyspo, Top, and Jiren.\n\nIn Broly when battling Super Saiyan Broly, Frieza becomes Golden Frieza to battle the mighty foe, fighting him alone for one hour. He retains the form even afterwards and tries to shoot down Cheelai and Lemo's ship, however he is stopped by Gogeta and chooses to revert to his final form.\n\nIn Super Dragon Ball Heroes, Cooler reveals he attained this form at some point during his time on the Prison Planet. However, in all his uses of it, he uses it in conjunction with his Fourth Transformation, resulting in a hybrid form.\n\nGolden Meta-Cooler overheats\nGolden Meta-Cooler overheats\n\nIn the anime version of the Universal Conflict Saga, in search for power and after being modified into Meta-Cooler after learning from Fu how to do it, Cooler transforms into Golden Meta-Cooler to battle a weakened Super Saiyan 3 Cumber. He manages to overwhelm Cumber, though overheats at the end of their battle and retreats.\n\nIn the manga version of the Universal Conflict Saga, Meta-Cooler immediately transforms into Golden Meta-Cooler to combat the heavily weakened Super Saiyan Cumber. Using his full power, Cooler has the edge over the injured Saiyan and attempts to finish him with a quadruple Golden Supernova, however, Cumber manages to survive it by turning into a Super Saiyan 3 - though he is defeated.\n\nFrieza and Meta-Cooler take this form to battle Goku and Hearts\nFrieza and Meta-Cooler take this form to battle Goku and Hearts\n\nIn the anime version of the New Space-Time War Saga, after Hearts incapacitates them with his gravity, Frieza and Meta-Cooler take on this form to battle Goku and Hearts. While Golden Meta-Cooler battles Hearts, Golden Frieza goes after Goku, who takes on his Ultra Instinct Sign state in response to being hit by Frieza's Golden Death Ball, he then lands a barrage of blows on Frieza, knocking the tyrant down but only dealing minor damage. Suddenly Golden Frieza and Golden Meta-Cooler are merged with Dark Dragon Balls sent to them by the Crimson-Masked Saiyan.\n\nGolden Frieza and Golden Meta-Cooler as members of Team 5 during the Super Space-Time Tournament\nGolden Frieza and Golden Meta-Cooler as members of Team 5 during the Super Space-Time Tournament\n\nDuring the Supreme Kai of Time Saga, both Golden Frieza and Golden Meta-Cooler are members of Team 5 (along with Hearts, Cumber, Super 17, and Dr. Wheelo) during the Super Space-Time Tournament hosted by Chronoa's predecessor Aeos after she and the Warriors in Black seize control over the Time Nest, due to Aeos believing Chronoa is unfit for the position due to the number of timelines that has increased under her tenure as Supreme Kai of Time. Eventually it is revealed that the Super Space-Time Tournament is modeled after the Tournament of Power not only in the fact it is team based will also lead to the erasure of the timelines that said teams represent.\n\nDrawbacks\n\"Your new form is burning through more power than your body can supply. You should have waited until you were used to this form and knew how to regulate it before you started picking fights.\"\n— Goku warning Frieza about the disadvantages on his Golden Form in Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’\n\nDespite its tremendous power, the form has a serious flaw: namely, it experiences a severe decrease in stamina from prolonged periods of use without proper control of the intense energy, with the form only lasting just over five minutes before its power begins to take drastic drops, in the anime.[12][13] However, it is mentioned by Goku and Vegeta that if Frieza had trained further upon completing his evolution to Golden Frieza, he could have negated the rapid power-draining effect entirely, thereby allowing Frieza to stay in the form for as long as he pleased without losing any stamina. Frieza, however, refused to wait any longer beyond his initial training, not having enough patience to put off his revenge against Goku any longer.\n\nIn the anime, Frieza began rectifying his mistake after being sent back to Hell again with the angels torturing him. In the midst of his eternal torment, Frieza underwent mental training to preserve his sanity. He used mental image training by focusing and imagining a battle simulation of killing Goku and how to exact revenge on him, over and over again. After a while, Frieza managed to overcome this stress and improved his ki manipulation. By doing so, he finally mastered his Golden Frieza state, granting him nearly perfect ki control after being temporarily revived. At this point, Frieza dubs this empowered state the True Golden Frieza.[14] In the manga, Frieza simply gets stronger, and no mention is made of him fixing his stamina flaw.\n\nBy the time of Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Frieza's stamina issues appeared to be completely gone, as Frieza could fight as Golden Frieza for over an hour, even under intense conditions.\n\nIn the manga, Cooler also exhibits the stamina drain in this form, but to an even greater degree than Frieza - being forced to revert to his final form mere moments after turning into Golden Cooler.\n\nIn the anime, it is shown that this form is very taxing on a cybernetically modified user, as Meta-Cooler overheated after using the form for a short time.\n\nAdvancements\nFury Golden Frieza - By undergoing an intense amount of rage, the user powers up into Fury Golden Frieza, causing their eyes to go bloodshot and also on occasions; their veins to bulge, their body to glow, and gift them with a greater level of power.\nTrue Golden Frieza - The result of the user gaining complete control over the form and achieving perfect energy manipulation.\nBlack Frieza - A form far surpassing Golden Frieza achieved by Frieza after training for 10 years.\nFourth Transformation hybrid state - When Cooler transforms into his Golden Cooler form, he does so while already being in his Fourth Transformation, resulting in a form with the hybrid appearance of both states. Prior to this, the Frieza Clan Berserker also displayed a form that resembled a hybrid of the two.\nCosmic Suit - Meta-Cooler is able to use the Golden Form, resulting in him becoming Golden Meta-Cooler. In Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, a member of the Frieza Race can use Turn Golden when wearing a Cosmic Suit.\nGame advancements\nFrieza utilizing Golden Frieza and Supervillain at the same time\nFrieza utilizing Golden Frieza and Supervillain at the same time\n\nSupervillain - After being affected dark magic that allows a user of this form to shave off life in order to achieve a new level of power, a member of Frieza's race who possess the Golden Frieza form can utilize it alongside the Supervillain form, granting them an even more powerful form. By using Supervillain alongside Golden Frieza, the Frieza Race member's biological armor in this form changes from a golden color to a platinum color.\nUltra Supervillain - After being given special Demon Realm Crystals from Fu, Golden Frieza achieves this state.\nTime Power Unleashed - After using a Demon Realm Crystal to force Shenron into Ultra Supervillain state, Golden Frieza partially achieves a wish to become Supreme Kai of Time.\nSuper God Class-up - The Frieza Clan avatars gain the ability to use a second variant of their Golden forms via Super God Class-up, turning their eyes blue and their bio-gems silver.\nUltra Instinct Sign hybrid state - The Frieza Clan Avatars can use the Ultimate Class-up Sign state, allowing them to achieve Ultra Instinct Sign which retains the bio suits of their Golden Forms, though with the silver eyes of Ultra Instinct Sign.\nPerfected Ultra Instinct hybrid state - The Frieza Clan avatars can use the Ultimate Class-up to achieve the Perfected Ultra Instinct while in their Golden Forms, resulting in their arms and legs becoming silver in color.\nThe avatars using the Super God Class Golden Frieza form\nThe avatars using the Super God Class Golden Frieza form\nUltimate Class-up Sign Frieza Clan Hero\nUltimate Class-up Sign Frieza Clan Hero\nUltimate Class-up Sign Frieza Clan Elite\nUltimate Class-up Sign Frieza Clan Elite\nUltimate Class-up Sign Frieza Clan Berserker\nUltimate Class-up Sign Frieza Clan Berserker\nVariations\nGame Variants\nTurn Golden - An Awoken Skill transformation and True Golden Frieza equivalent available to Frieza Race Time Patrollers in Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, such as the Future Warrior after they usurp the position of Galactic Emperor in the Frieza's Spaceship Time Miniature rift then training with Cooler and Frieza. Additionally, the Frieza Race Toki Toki City Hero (as part of the Conton City Tournament online single player event after the 1.15.00 Update DLC) achieves it prior to entering the Conton City Tournament where they utilize the Awoken Skill transformation as an enemy NPC.\nFilm Appearances\nFrieza punches Goku\nFrieza punches Goku\n\nIn Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’, Frieza transforms into Golden Frieza in order to unlock some of his latent potential against Goku in his Super Saiyan Blue form. Golden Frieza has control throughout the fight until Goku and Vegeta figure out his weakness. Golden Frieza's power then begins to decline because Frieza had not gotten used to the form, eager to fight before he was ready. After Golden Frieza is defeated, he uses the help of Sorbet to take Goku down. Golden Frieza attacks Goku until Vegeta steps up to combat him using his Super Saiyan Blue form and knocks Golden Frieza back into his final form.\n\n\"You dare make me exert myself?

The last thing you will ever see!\"\n— Frieza facing against Broly in Dragon Ball Super: Broly\n\nGolden Frieza charges at Broly.\nGolden Frieza charges at Broly.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Frieza takes this form when he is forced to fight Super Saiyan Broly. Golden Frieza fights Broly for over an hour in this form. Although he's able to hold his own for that time, Broly holds the edge over Frieza during their match. The film's novelization expands upon the fight, noting that Golden Frieza's strength pressured Broly at times. After over an hour has passed, Golden Frieza is no longer capable of fighting, leading Broly to head away to attack Whis. Frieza retains his golden form through Gogeta's battle with Broly and only drops out of it once the fighting has ended.\n\nVideo Game Appearances\nDragon Ball Heroes\nDragon Ball: Zenkai Battle\nDragon Ball Xenoverse\nDragon Ball Discross\nDragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle\nDragon Ball Z: Extreme Butōden\nDragon Ball Fusions\nDragon Ball Xenoverse 2\nDragon Ball FighterZ\nDragon Ball Legends\nSuper Dragon Ball Heroes: World Mission\nDragon Ball Z: Kakarot\nFortnite x Dragon Ball Super\nDragon Ball: Sparking! Zero\nIn Dragon Ball Heroes, the Frieza Clan avatars are capable of using the Golden Frieza form via the God Class-up. Their God Class-up Golden Frieza forms differ in that they gain the ability to utilize Godly ki. Cooler achieves Golden Cooler in the Prison Planet Saga in Super Dragon Ball Heroes, introduced in the second mission of the Universe Mission series (UM2).\n\nIn Dragon Ball Fusions, Golden Frieza appears as a separate playable form of Frieza who is accidentally freed from Earth's Hell by Tekka's Team when they open a time hole near Frieza's Spaceship in Area 2F of the Timespace Rift which causes Frieza to somehow be resurrected. Golden Frieza appears in the post-game Sub-Event: \"The Return of F\" in which Tekka's Team encounter Frieza at The Lookout and he transforms into his Golden Frieza form. Defeating Golden Frieza and completing this Sub-Event makes Frieza (Final Form) and Golden Frieza scoutable, allowing Tekka's Team to recruit them by KOing either of them with a Zenkai Attack.\n\nFrieza Race Future Warrior's Turn Golden form in Xenoverse 2\nFrieza Race Future Warrior's Turn Golden form in Xenoverse 2\n\nIn Xenoverse 2, a Frieza Race Future Warrior can also use this form which appears as the Frieza Clan's racially exclusive Awoken Skill Turn Golden, which the Warrior can obtain by training with Golden Frieza after overthrowing him and taking his title as Emperor of the Universe as well as leadership of the Frieza Force inside the Frieza's Spaceship time rift anomaly. There are also two Super Souls that activate when using Turn Golden (referred to as Golden Mode in Super Soul descriptions) the first being Golden Frieza's Super Soul \"The gold represents the new me.\" and Goku's Super Soul \"I'm still not used to this form!\". When Goku's Super Soul is equipped, it effectively represents the unmastered Golden Frieza form as it causes the user's ki to deplete while utilizing the Turn Golden form.\n\nIn addition to the transformation, one of the Frieza Force Tracksuits that can be obtained during the Frieza's Siege event is Tracksuit (Golden Frieza Colors) which has the coloration of Golden Frieza though with a metallic sheen much like the Tracksuit (Metal Cooler Colors) based on Metal Cooler. As part of the 1.15.00 Update DLC, during Conton City Tournament 05: \"The Fated Finale\", if the Toki Toki City Hero (chosen earlier in the game or transferred over from Xenoverse) is Frieza Race, then the Conton City Hero will have to face the Toki Toki City Hero in their Turn Golden Awoken Skill transformation after reducing their health by a certain amount. As Turn Golden was unavailable in Xenoverse, the Toki Toki City Hero must have obtained it some point in between the end of Xenoverse and their participation in the Conton City Tournament. As long as they are Frieza Race, the Toki Toki City Hero will utilize their Turn Golden form during the final matches of the tournament, as Supreme Kai of Time Chronoa is the tournament's true final opponent. Like the Frieza Race Conton City Hero, the Frieza Race Toki Toki City Hero seems to have mastered Golden Frieza form.\n\nCooler's Metal Cooler transformation\nCooler's Metal Cooler transformation\n\nAlso in Xenoverse 2, via training during the Frieza's spaceship missions, Cooler manages to obtain the ​​Metal Cooler (メタルクウラ Metaru Kūra, lit. \"Metal Coora\") form. Metal Cooler is achieved the same way as Golden Frieza in-game, and acts as Cooler's equivalent to it. This iteration of the Ultimate Evolution appears identical to the Meta-Cooler cyborgs manufactured by the Big Gete Star but is different from them in that it is not robotic. The form is identical to Cooler's base form but with a metallic Bio Suit, similar to a Cosmic Suit, worn over it, resulting in a form superior to Cooler's fifth form.\n\nFrieza shows off his Golden form to his opponent\nFrieza shows off his Golden form to his opponent\n\nIn FighterZ, Golden Frieza is a Super Special Attack that expends three bars of ki to use. During the main story, Frieza has access to the form as his Super Special Move which functions as it does in other modes. Interestingly, the Clone Friezas also have it as a Super Special Move indicating that they were likely cloned from Frieza after he had acquired it. However, the clones are never shown utilizing it.\n\nULTRA Golden Frieza (DBL69-03U) Card Art in Dragon Ball Legends\nULTRA Golden Frieza (DBL69-03U) Card Art in Dragon Ball Legends\n\nIn Dragon Ball Legends, Golden Frieza appears as a playable character, Golden Frieza (DBL13-06S). Additionally, it also appears as a transformation for Final Form Frieza (DBL18-01S) which transforms into Golden Frieza (DBL18-01S). On March 27, 2024, Dragon Ball Legends released ULTRA Golden Frieza (DBL69-03U) who introduces a new ability into the game called Comeback. When Golden Frieza (DBL69-03U)'s health reaches 0 he falls to his knees and Sorbet shoots Bad Ring Laser at the opponent, damaging him. Then Golden Frieza leaps at the opponent and kicks them. This ability is only usable once per battle, and Golden Frieza replenishes half of his health.\n\nIn World Mission, Golden Frieza appears as a playable character. Frieza (Resurrected) can also transform into Golden Frieza. Additionally, Beat can utilize the form if Frieza Race is selected for his Hero Avatar and upgrades his Frieza Race Avatar to God Class while upgrading to Super God Class that grants him the ability to utilize Super God Class enhanced Golden form. Additionally, Froze can utilize the form once he reaches God Class and its enhanced version after achieving Super God Class.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nTrivia\nPure Gold Frieza\nPure Gold Frieza\n\nToriyama made Frieza gold in this form because he was unable to make Frieza's form any simpler and so decided to mainly just alter its color, making it gold because that felt like the strongest and because he associated it with gold medals.[15]\nFrieza has a merchandise-only joke form that is the result of Frieza \"over-training\", causing him to gain an Ultimate Evolution-like state that is pure gold in appearance. This form is referred to as Pure Gold Frieza.[16]\nIt was stated by Ryusei Nakao that because Frieza was a \"nice guy\" (ナイスガイ; naisu gai), Golden Frieza's power level in this form is 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 (垓; gai or one hundred quintillion).[17]\nIn Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, if Golden Frieza fights Cooler (Final Form) in battle, Cooler will be shocked, saying \"What manner of transformation is this?! Tell me at once, Frieza!\", causing Frieza to respond to his demands by taunting his elder brother, \"Oh, don't throw a fit. Aren't you supposed to be the older one?\" then laughs while reveling in the fact that his older brother realizes that Frieza has a form superior to Cooler's Fourth Transformation.\nAdditionally, in the English dub of Xenoverse 2, Meta-Cooler will tell his brother to go polish that Golden Form he is so proud of when Frieza mocks him and Meta-Cooler Corps after they are defeated in a Parallel Quest during an Ultimate Finish.\nMecha Frieza's alternate colors in Supersonic Warriors\nMecha Frieza's alternate colors in Supersonic Warriors\n\nIn Xenoverse 2, it is shown that the Golden Frieza form can be utilized alongside Frieza Race cybernetic enhancements.\nYears before Golden Frieza's debut in Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors, Mecha Frieza possessed an alternate coloration which resembled Golden Frieza.\nIronically considering Frieza's prior fear of it, the form is similar to Super Saiyan due to its golden color, aura, and extreme power boost.\nTurn Golden is the only Awoken Skill transformation introduced in Xenoverse 2, that the Toki Toki City Hero is shown to have achieved. While they can utilize Ultimate Awoken Skill if their race is Earthling, Majin, or Namekian, it simply represents their Unlock Potential transformation from Xenoverse (as Unlock Potential was essentially replaced by Potential Unleashed, even though Elder Kai's ritual is not performed to achieve it in Xenoverse 2, which ironically was how the Toki Toki City Hero obtains Unlock Potential in Xenoverse).\nThe likely reason that Potential Unleashed was utilized over Power Pole Pro, Become Giant, and Purification is due to the Toki Toki City Hero being fought as an enemy NPC in a online single player event (as those forms would be impractical due to their drawbacks making them harder to implement against the player, as Potential Unleashed function similar to Turn Golden and Super Saiyan God, as well enemy NPCs with Super Saiyan Awoken Skills thus was far easier to implement).","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"blfhvd0dd","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
