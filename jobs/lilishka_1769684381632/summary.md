Personality
She has a chūnibyō personality. Many of her schoolmates see her as unusual because of this. Because of her vampiric heritage, she dislikes direct sunlight, although being exposed to it will not make her burn.

Background
She is a vampire. She is a high school student and is a member of the occult club. She has familiar that is a male bat named Floof.

Relationships
Shintarō Tokumitsu
Ever since she first met Shintaro she has been attracted to his scent and by extension he himself. Quite often when they meet she ends up sniffing him. She tends to visit his home at night in order to nibble on his neck, an action she calls 'nom-noming'. She is even willing to undress in front of him claiming she would only do so for him.

Floof
Floof is a male bat who acts as Lilishka's familiar, which is fitting considering that Lilishka is a vampire. She dislikes when people refer to him as a bat. She often uses him as messenger pigeon.
