She wore two hair pins near her left eye.\n\nPersonality\nGinna is an energetic, flamboyant and groupie girl, conducting the assigned task with great enthusiasm. Ginna is a fan of the Anti-Demon Corps, especially towards Chiefs. It is made obvious enough from the fact, she overreacts whenever seeing Kyouka and Tenka fighting off the Shuuki and Rairen, having full knowledge about their combat preference and desiring to see them fight.\n\nAside from this, she held little-to-no opinion on men, who're unable to reach the same status as the women among the corps, which was shown when she looked at Yuuki with disgust. However, this changed after she witnessed him fighting alongside Kyouka in his slave form, to the point of asking him for his autograph.\n\nGinna also holds a great deal of respect and admiration for Ren.\n\nGinna also has great confidence in her Peach Blessing working. She was shown to be shocked when her barrier was broken by Rairen.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"f0bnt5nkk","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"toupm7e9c","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"vy920xz9r","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"2xc3lnnab","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"q3mcqcgle","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"py5dw1i81","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"w61aihaac","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"vx54vt0ff","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"7q7ob60fa","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"vdwuu1540","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
