She is one of the \"Archons\" (the largest fighting force of the Empire) who has fearsome power that rivals that of Mitama, but mentally she is quite childish, making her easy to manipulate.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAppearance\nAtar has white short Hair with a black/blue striped horn above her right eye. Her eye color is yellow, but her left eye resembles a yellow/red reticle pupil on an otherwise black eyeball. There are also a few yellow stripes on the left side of her face, aiming from her left eye outwards. Her skin is mostly white with areas which appear black, with blue jagged lines bordering them. She wears a white jacket with black lines, which covers her torso, left arm and her hips. Her right arm is most of the time covered by a cape-like piece of cloth on her side, connected to the collar piece on her jacket.\n\n00:00\n\n41:20\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter becoming an official god by gaining followers, Atar's left eye returns to normal, and she starts wearing a black dress. She also adds a blue and white ribbon to her outfit, making her appear more human compared to her previous droid-like appearance. She begins wearing boots and loses the ragged black textures on her legs, along with the reticle pupil and stripes in her left eye, and the horn. Furthermore, the black Archon tech on her right hand becomes visible, now more refined compared to its ragged appearance in her pre-god form. She also gains a scar with the black Archon tech on the right side of her face. (I don't know if this lazy animation or something, but her black Archon tech only appears if she uses her powers)\n\n\nAdvertisement\nPersonality\nAtar is a proud and Stoic agent of the empire that follows the order of the assembly without question. Whenever she sees an obstacle, she is determined to overwhelm it with her power. She proved to be a fearsome opponent against Yukito and Mitama, but once subdued, she became confused and ashamed in the empire. Upon realizing the emperor was dead, and the government was propped up by science, she lost all hope. It was only through Yukito's support (albeit through some trickery on his part) and love for ice cream that she was able to become happy and regain her confidence. Showing a softer side and became a reliable ally to the heroes.\n\nPlot\nAtar was introduced as the first villain in the anime, following the commands of another Archon named Loki after Mitama's rampage through the capital to rescue Yukito in his dying moments. Atar sought to find the people responsible for the rampage by visiting each isolation village one by one to see their faces in person and eliminate them. However, Loki tricked her into killing an outer beast, which gave the village time to prepare against Atar. When Atar approached the village, Bertrand confronted her in battle, but Atar was clearly stronger than the village knight. Fortunately for Bertrand, Yukito and the rest arrived just in time to rescue him with Mitama's help. After a while, they were evenly matched in strength and power, but when Atar entered her Archon battle form, and Mitama pulled out her trump card by calling on other gods for help, the battle shifted. Despite Mitama's meager following, they only battled briefly before the gods assisting Mitama left, leaving them at a disadvantage. Just as they were about to be defeated, Klen/Loki intervened and stopped Atar before she could blast and vaporize them with her power.\n\nAfter being captured by Loki and left behind, Atar stayed with Yukito. Loki left the village while Atar cried in despair over the loss of the Assembly and the empire. Yukito noticed her distress and gave her a speech encouraging her to repair and fix what was lost, but they needed to join the village first. In the end, Atar idolizes Yukito for helping her regain her power and for introducing her to the existence of ice cream.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nGallery\nAtar being fed ice cream by Yukito and crying afterward.\nAtar being fed ice cream by Yukito and crying afterward.\n","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"wm786hwab","mimeType":"image/webp"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
