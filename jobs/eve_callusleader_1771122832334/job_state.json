One of her main notable traits are her bunny ears. She usually wears a black leotard with fishnet stockings (which Ryota calls a \"bunny girl outfit\" due to tropes in games and anime).\n\n\nAdvertisement\nBiography\nEve is an adventurer whose trademark is her own pair of bunny ears and bunny-girl outfit. She loves carrots and is famous as a carrot connoisseur. It is rumored that her special weapon, Excalibur (karate chop), can cut even a rock in half.\n\nPast\nAs a child, Eve hated vegetables and her drop rate for plants was terrible, so she only ever got equally terrible vegetables. During her exploration of the dungeon, she killed a monster and a little boy appeared as a \"drop\". This boy, who greatly resembled a young Ryota, also had high drop rates and got a carrot as a drop. After forcing Eve to eat the carrot, which unlink the previous carrots she had tried, actually tasted good, she became infatuated with eating carrots. Before she ever got a chance to enjoy the company of her new friend however he disappeared before her eyes.\n\nAs she got older she started purposefully hunting any monsters that would drop carrots when defeated due to her newfound obsession with them, being disappointed by low quality carrots. This earned her the moniker 'Carrot Junkie' as well as a reputation as a carrot sommelier.\n\nMeeting Ryota in Telulu\nEve met Ryota Sato in Telulu’s second level, where she karate chopped him on the head and walked away, interested in why it didn't do anything to him. After this she ends up finding out where he lives and upon being greeted by him at the door proceeds to karate chop him more. She ends up pulling out a carrot, which she had discovered was one of his. She proceeds to tell him that she \"wuvs carrots\". Eve, being a bit of a carrot connoisseur, had liked the carrots Ryota had collected so much that she started to follow him around in order to convince him to get her more carrots.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nSkills\nExcalibur: Eve’s signature move, she unleashes a powerful karate chop that can break through anything. When Eve used this chop on another adventurer, it not only knocked them out but it also caused him to bleed profusely. It is so strong that she can easily shatter rocks with one blow.\nDue to her rabbit ears she has a heightened sense of hearing.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"flxurj6ui","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
