He is a member of the criminals leaded by Dr. Simon Fessenden and a volunteer for becoming a strongest creature. He and his men attacks a village with the brainwashed dinosaurs. A villager communicates him with the heroes about their village is under attack. Later, the heroes beat all thugs and encounter the villager.

However, he is beaten again and finally dies.\n\nPowers and Abilities\nMorgan: In the battle, Morgan uses his Uzi, knives, stones and grenades to attack the player.
