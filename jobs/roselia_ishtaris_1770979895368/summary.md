Roselia Ishtaris (ロゼリア・イシュタリス, Rozeria Ishutarisu) is a pivotal supporting character of Seiken Gakuin no Makentsukai. She is the goddess known as the Maiden of Rebellion, who saved Leonis Death Magnus when he nearly died from human's betrayal and turned him into a Dark Lord. She is the sole reason for Leonis' decision to rebuild the devil army after hibernating a thousand years.
Appearance
From Leonis' view, Roselia is a beautiful woman with long purple hair and golden eyes.

Personality
She was kind towards Leonis but she wanted to destroy the world :)

Background
The origin of Roselia is vague, other than that she is a Goddess called the Maiden of Rebellion. She met Leonis when he was about to die after being betrayed and executed by human. She resurrected the boy once called a hero, changing him into a Dark Lord. She saved Leonis when he’d lost faith in this world, and then she went on to try to save the world itself.

Sometime later, when Leonis became very strong, she gave Leonis a Demon Sword named Dáinsleif; he only could use it to protect his "kingdom", and he accepted it. The time she spent with Leonis came to an end when she suddenly felt ill. Being a Goddess in a romantic relation with a being with lesser standards than her was partially the cause. She did prepare Leonis in advance that she would not die completely but she would reincarnate as a human girl but the process would take a millennium and she was going to loose all her memories and her power would be split from her. She pleaded Leonis to keep the memories for her, which he vows to. When the time finally came, before saying farewell to Leonis, she reminded him to look for her after a thousand years and try to continue saving the world himself. A thousand years later her reincarnation, Riselia Ray Crystalia, ended up finding him instead.
