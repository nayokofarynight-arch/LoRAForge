In place of a head, she wore a black helmet.\n\nUnderneath her helmet and trench coat, she has the appearance of a young girl with long tied green hair while wearing a green leotard and a red necktie. On her ears she has three diamond shaped piercings on each side.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonality\nFrom what little is shown, Jaku'un is a polite and courteous individual towards fellow Hachiraishin, welcoming Shikoku and Jouryuu as she is the youngest of their group.\n\nSynopsis\n\n\nPowers and Abilities\nOverview\nShuuki Powers\nMedical Knowledge: As the designated doctor of their group, it is assumed Jaku'un is versed in medical arts. She is responsible for turning human into Devotees and their transformations into Shuuki.\n\nCurse Placement: While unconfirmed, it is highly likely that Jaku'un is the one who cursed the Devotees she created with a sun mark. This curse is activated when a Devoted is defeated, causing the body to explode from within leading to death. The mark cannot be removed (not even with Transience), and even if the part of the body on which it is imprinted is removed, it immediately appears on another. The only survivor among the defeated Devotees was Yumeji Shimomura, who used her Peach Blessing to survive despite her wounds.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"qa6j82nyu","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"uoyua01os","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"tmagysvbz","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"r7qs2rj09","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"e3naj9s6f","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"fo4d3br7r","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
