Appearance
Haruno is a young woman with a kind face, and long hair done up in a braid. She also has an especially large bust.

While on duty, Haruno wears the formal version of the Anti-Demon Corps uniform, with a double-breasted long-sleeved jacket and a maxi-skirt. Haruno also wears epaulettes and collar tabs, and has origami-shaped hair ornaments on her right temple and at the end of her braid.

Personality
Haruno is kind and gentle, and cares deeply for her comrades. She believes that human lives come first, and is willing to do anything which will further the Anti-Demon Corps mission of protecting humankind - even trying out 'Lending' with Kyouka Uzen's Slave power. Haruno also supported Yumeji Shimomura's decision to promote Kyouka to be her unit's Vice-Chief, despite being her senior.

As a veteran of the 7th Unit, Haruno is familiar with the current active-duty members, and is well-liked by all of them. She was especially close with Kyouka and Yumeji, and appreciates her time spent with them before being assigned to the Away Team.



Background
Haruno first enlisted in the Anti-Demon Corps to fulfil her goal of protecting those around her. After completing her basic training, she was assigned to the 7th Unit, with Yumeji as her Chief. She later welcomed Kyouka as a new member, after the latter joined the 7th Unit.

Haruno would later be reassigned to the Away Team, tasked with exploring Mato and collecting Mato Peaches for consumption in its most remote and dangerous areas.

Synopsis
Haruno returns to the 7th Unit to take charge while Kyouka attends the Commander's Election in the Shangri-La dimension. She notes how much neater the base has become since her reassignment, due to Yuuki fulfilling his duties as caretaker.

After the election, Haruno caught up with the other members of the 7th Unit, and became acquainted with Yuuki Wakura. She introduced him to her ability, Origami, which she had been honing during Kyouka's absence, and granted him some shikigami (familiars) to use around the base for chores.

Haruno later accompanied Kyouka and Yuuki into the field for a Shuuki extermination mission. She requested to borrow Kyouka's power, unlocking a new form in the process. After testing out its capabilities, Haruno mentioned that this could be used to heal Yumeji, who was recovering after her second duel with Kyouka.

Haruno later granted Yuuki a reward, cleaning his ears for him, kissing him, and allowing him to nurse from her breasts. She expressed gratitude to Yuuki for granting Kyouka some comfort in her role as Chief of her Unit, from all of the troubles she had to handle. When asked about her own source of comfort, Haruno said that being able to see everyone's smiling faces was her source of comfort.

Powers and Abilities
Like all members of the Anti-Demon Corps, Haruno was granted an ability after consuming a Mato Peach. She is powerful enough to hold her own in direct combat, both as a member of the 7th Unit and on the Away Team.

Peach Blessing
Origami (遙乃式神オリガミ, Origami, lit. "Haruno Shikigami"): Haruno's power allows her to bring origami animals to life as shikigami - spiritual familiars which she can control at will. Haruno must fold the animals herself before infusing them with her power.

The shikigami can be used to attack enemies, or protect Haruno's allies. Outside of combat, the shikigami can also perform simple tasks such as helping with household chores.

Blessed Rain (無窮の鎖スレイブ・祝福雨恵みの雨, Sureibu: Blessed Rain, lit. "Eternal Chain: Megumi no Ame"): The Slave Form which Yuuki assumes, with Haruno acting as his Master through "Lending". Yuuki dons the robes of a traditional Chinese healer. He has no attack power in this form, with all of his power devoted to healing and recovery. He can generate a rainstorm which can heal any living being within its area of effect, including himself. Yuuki can heal ordinarily life-threatening injuries with this ability, though it cannot regenerate severed limbs, and cannot revive the dead.
