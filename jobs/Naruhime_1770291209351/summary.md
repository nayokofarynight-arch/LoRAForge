Appearance
Naruhime is a petite young girl who is dressed in black booty shorts and an open yellow jacket that covers her arms, but leaves her ample bosom wide open, only to be covered by a thin black bikini that doesn't even support her gazangas. Her short hair reaches the shoulder and consist of blonde and brunette strips. Above her left eye was a lightning-shaped hair pin. Naruhime also has vertical slit pupils for her blue eyes.

Naruhime also appears to have short and stubby yellow horns in the shape of small lightning bolts. And it can be seen that she is wearing some sort of high waisted thong beneath her booty shorts

Personality
From what is shown, Naruhime is shown to be a violent but stoic individual, attacking Jouryuu as a form of test to see if she's able to retain her calmness. She is also very impatient and overbearing, as she often shouting everything she says, much to the discomfort of her fellow Thunder Gods. Her arrogance, impatience, and violent temper make her very reckless, as she reportingly express her desire to attack the Anti-Demon Corps and kill some of it's chiefs to display her godly authority to the humans instead of waiting around for Shikoku's plan to unfold.
