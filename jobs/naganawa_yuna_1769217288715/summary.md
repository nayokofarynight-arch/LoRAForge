Personality
Background
Yuna is a 13 year old middle school student. She was being bullied and so her mother hired the private detective Sōsuke Kaburaya in order to investigate. The reason that she wouldn't tell anyone she was being bullied was the fact that she didn't want to cause problems for her mother due to the ringleader of the bullies being the daughter of the president of the company where her mother works. When she learned that Sara was going to be attending school she decided to transfer to the school that Sara would probably be going to, partly to escape from how uncomfortable she was at her current school, only to find out that Sara would actually be one grade below her effectively leaving her by herself in a new school. At her new school, 'Gifu Municipal Sawara Middle School', Yuna becomes acquainted with a girl, Mizuki Imahariyama, who was being bullied after helping her with her problem. After helping Mizuki, Yuna realizes she had fun acting like a detective and decides that she wants to be a detective in the future.
