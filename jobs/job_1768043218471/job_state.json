She is ruthless towards Light's enemies, often serving as the group's interrogator by analyzing victims' memories or inflicting calculated pain. Outside the Abyss, she operates under the alias \"Witch of the Giant Tower\" (Kyotou no Majo), posing as the master of the tower to draw attention away from Light.\nAppearance\nEllie is a beautiful young woman with a curvaceous figure. She has long blonde hair styled into twin tails and typically wears a revealing witch's outfit with a large hat.\n\nPersonality\nEllie is an unfiltered and seductive individual who frequently makes suggestive or adult-oriented comments, often teasing Light or bickering with Nazuna about maturity.\n\nShe is fanatically devoted to Light, whom she worships as \"Blessed Lord Light.\" Among Light's subordinates, she is the most outspoken about her romantic and sexual desire for him, often expressing jealousy if others get too close.\n\nDespite her playful demeanor, she is cold, calculating, and merciless towards enemies. She views humans who oppose Light as nothing more than \"trash\" or \"materials\" and has no qualms about using torture or forbidden magic to achieve her lord's goals. She is highly intelligent, often devising the strategies for Light's revenge plots (such as the plan to destroy the Beastkin Alliance).\n\nStory\nConquest of the Abyss\nEllie played a critical role in securing the \"Abyss\" as Light's base. When the party reached the deepest level, Ellie analyzed and seized control of the Dungeon Core. She successfully hacked the dungeon's logic, disabling the anti-teleportation field that trapped them, which allowed the party to travel freely between the surface and the Abyss.\n\nThe Witch of the Giant Tower\nDuring the revenge plot against Sasha, Ellie constructed the \"Giant Tower\" near the Elven Queendom using her magic and earth-based cards. She assumed the public persona of the \"Witch of the Giant Tower,\" declaring the \"Absolute Independence of Humans.\" She successfully intimidated the Elven Queen into submission and later orchestrated the annihilation of the Beastkin Alliance's army using the tower's defenses and her own magic.\n\nInvestigation of the \"Master\"\nEllie acts as the lead researcher in uncovering the mystery of the \"Masters.\" She conducted the memory probes on captured enemies like Kavaa and Yudo, uncovering the existence of the \"Avatar Project\" and the conflict between the Dragonute and Demon nations.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nRelationships\nLight: Ellie's devotion to Light is absolute, bordering on worship as she reverently calls him \"Blessed Lord Light.\" Her love for him is both romantic and sexual, and she is the most direct and vocal about her feelings among all of his followers.\nThe Four Sisters: She considers herself the \"Third Daughter\" of the SUR summons (Mei is the eldest, Aoyuki the second, and Nazuna the youngest). She often acts as a mentor to Nazuna, though they bicker frequently.\nAbilities\nEllie is the supreme magic user of the group, capable of casting spells from all attributes and classes without chanting.\n\nMagic Mastery: She can use Combat, Tactical, and Strategic class magics instantly.\nMemory Manipulation: She can forcibly read the memories of targets. If she is careless, the target's mind may break, but she is skilled enough to browse memories like a book without damaging the subject if she chooses.\nBiological Manipulation: She can create artificial pain nerves inside a target's body to inflict eternal agony (used on Kavaa).\nDungeon Management: She can analyze and control Dungeon Cores, allowing her to manipulate dungeon structures and rules.\n\nAdvertisement\nSpells\nRefer to the Rank Guide for the magic ranking system\n\nExtreme Class\nForbidden Magic - Nightmare Summon: A forbidden magic that opens a gate to another world to summon ferocious monsters (Level 9000+). Because it is dangerous and consumes massive mana, she can usually only cast it once a day.\nUltimate Life/Leaf: An extremely complex healing magic that Ellie can only activate through a prolonged incantation.\nStrategic Class\nDorn Fesseln (Thorn Binding): A binding spell that restrains high-level individuals with thorny vines.\nDimension Cut: A spell that slashes through space itself.\nGravity World: Crushes targets with immense gravitational pressure.\nPlasma Down: Calls down bolts of plasma energy.\nTactical Class\nSacer Arbor (Sacred Tree): Summons monstrous, carnivorous trees from the ground that entangle and devour enemies to grow larger. (Confirmed Tactical Class in Ch 50).\nSilent: A spell that blocks sound and corrodes the spirit of those trapped inside.\nConfusion: Mental interference magic.\nMemory Read\nOriginal Magic\nTeleportation Obstruction: A unique spell Ellie created by analyzing the Abyss Core. It prevents enemies from teleporting away from her domain.\n\nAdvertisement\nEquipment\nSSR Class\nHood of Obstruction - A hood capable of concealing the identity and status of the wearer from appraisal.\nPhantasm Class\nMagic Codex - A grimoire she carries that enhances her magical abilities.\nMythology Class\nWorld is World - A unique, one-time-use red dagger with intricate gold embellishments. When activated, it creates an isolated dimension (approx. 1km high and 3km wide) that separates the target from the rest of reality.\nAbsolute Isolation: The space created by this item cannot be interfered with from the outside, not even by Genesis-Class weapons. It is the ultimate cage used to ensure no enemy escapes.","quantity":25,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"5peelbrlr","mimeType":"image/webp"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
