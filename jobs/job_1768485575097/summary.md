Appearance
Naie is a young woman of small stature, with light purple pigtail haircut, golden eyes, and a red magic crystal in the middle of her forehead, which is undoubtedly the core of her magic. Her attires consist of the same purple cape that Maynard wears, a sleeveless purple dress with pink diamond-shaped patterns on her chest, pairs of stocking and iron boots and pairs of iron gauntlets. She always has her purple satchel with her.
Personality
Naie is a deeply fearful person, despite her stoic personality since her first appearance. She always seeking first to save her own life. She never wanted to take part in battles or dangerous adventures. However, after being defeated by Clen and his companions, she was forced to use her magic to serve as their flying mount. Although she suffers from the misadventures she encounters with them, she manages to survive and finally returns home. Unfortunately, her return is short-lived: she is forcibly sent to Solsain as a teacher. Even there, she cannot escape Klen and his turmoil: trouble always seems to find her.
