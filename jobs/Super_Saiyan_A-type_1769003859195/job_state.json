However, this was changed to have him fight in base form. As a result, they changed the hair color to black, yet left it in the Super Saiyan style and retained the golden aura.\n\nlogo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nOverview\nThe user powers up, gaining a golden aura and Super Saiyan-like hair without actually transforming into the state.\n\nUsage\nIn Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks, Future Trunks briefly assumes this state when training with Future Gohan, although he was unable to go full Super Saiyan due to not being strong enough yet.\n\nWhen aiding Gohan with the Father-Son Kamehameha in the manga, Goku appears with black Super Saiyan hair.\n\nIn the anime, Goku uses this ability when confronting Frieza, Cell, King Cold and the Ginyu Force in Hell. He uses the power to defeat the Ginyu Force and prepares to fight Cell until Pikkon attacks and defeats Cell in a few hits.[1]\n\nGohan briefly assumes the form when about to fight Kibito.\n\nIn the finale of the Tournament of Power, Goku is unable to properly maintain his Super Saiyan transformation, so as he charges at Jiren, he flickers in and out of Super Saiyan while maintaining the golden aura.\n\nLater, in Dragon Ball GT, Goku uses this power-up when starting his fight against Frieza and Cell in Hell. During the battle with Naturon Shenron, Goku briefly manifests his Super Saiyan aura in his base form while talking to Naturon before transforming to Super Saiyan 4.[1]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nFilm Appearances\nBrolyvVegeta1\nVegeta uses Super Saiyan power without transforming against Broly in Broly\nIn Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan, after Paragus confesses his plans to the Z Fighters, Broly, due to becoming agitated by Goku's presence, ends up approaching Goku and angrily calling out the latter's Saiyan name in a hostile manner. Broly then briefly manifests this transformation before promptly transforming into his Super Saiyan A-type.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound, Gohan partially transforms when to stop an attack from Bujin.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Super: Broly, when finding he is outmatched by Broly when the two are in their base forms, Vegeta channels some of his Super Saiyan power prior to fully taking on the transformation - giving him a golden outline and allowing him to overwhelm Broly. Gogeta later utilizes this ability while fighting Broly, who by that time was in his Full Power Super Saiyan form.\n\nVideo Game Appearances\nExtreme Butoden demo black hair SS Goku\nGoku with black Super Saiyan 2 hair on the cover of Extreme Butoden\nDragon Ball Heroes\nDragon Ball Z: Extreme Butōden\nSeveral cards featuring artwork of Goku using this power is featured in Dragon Ball Heroes. The card has the ability Super Saiyan Power! (超サイヤパワー！, Sūpā Saiya Pawā!),[1] which makes it that, if Goku transforms into Super Saiyan on the second turn after a Kamehameha, his power is +2000, or +5000 if it is greatly successful, transforming him into Super Saiyan 2.\n\nGoku appears with black Super Saiyan 2 hair on the cover of Extreme Butōden's demo version.\n\nTrivia\nIn the colored version of the Dragon Ball Super manga, Goku and Vegeta were depicted with golden auras when at full power but low on energy and unable to transform against Infinite Zamasu and later Moro.\nIn Super Dragon Ball Heroes, Xeno Pan generated a similar Super Saiyan Power! golden aura when shared her ki to aid Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta in obtaining Super Full Power Saiyan 4 Limit Breaker.\nIn the light novel adaption of Super Hero, Gohan uses an \"incomplete Super Saiyan\" form when Soldier #15 comes to his house.\nGallery\nGoku with black Super Saiyan hair in the manga\nGoku with black Super Saiyan hair in the manga\nGoku using the ability\nGoku using the ability\nGoku partially transforms against Cell and Frieza\nGoku partially transforms against Cell and Frieza\nBroly partially transforms before becoming a Super Saiyan A-type in Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan\nBroly partially transforms before becoming a Super Saiyan A-type in Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan\nGohan partially transforms in Bojack Unbound\nGohan partially transforms in Bojack Unbound\nGogeta partially transforming in Broly\nGogeta partially transforming in Broly\nFuture Trunks partially transforming in The History of Trunks\nFuture Trunks partially transforming in The History of Trunks\nSon Goku (PJ-02) card for Dragon Ball Heroes\nSon Goku (PJ-02) card for Dragon Ball Heroes\nSon Goku (H4-09) card with the ability Super Saiyan Power! for Dragon Ball Heroes\nSon Goku (H4-09) card with the ability Super Saiyan Power! for Dragon Ball Heroes\nGohan partially transforms in the manga\nGohan partially transforms in the manga\nGoku uses the ability in anticipation of the Ginyu Force\nGoku uses the ability in anticipation of the Ginyu Force\nGoku easily takes down the Ginyu Force\nGoku easily takes down the Ginyu Force\nGoku partially transforms before becoming a Super Saiyan 4 against Naturon Shenron\nGoku partially transforms before becoming a Super Saiyan 4 against Naturon Shenron\nGohan partially transforms in Bojack Unbound\nGohan partially transforms in Bojack Unbound\nVegeta partially transforms in Broly\nVegeta partially transforms in Broly\nGogeta partially transforming in Broly\nGogeta partially transforming in Broly\nFuture Trunks partially transforming in The History of Trunks\nFuture Trunks partially transforming in The History of Trunks\nSon Goku (H6-26) card for Dragon Ball Heroes\nSon Goku (H6-26) card for Dragon Ball Heroes\n","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"o2vymzfjf","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"gjpstyr3e","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"tfod8ujxv","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"sm9ynrgsq","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"vhgwplz26","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"h3ob8hwsv","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"u0pbyiqcv","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"vg2fijs5t","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"75onibliz","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"czznta8ks","mimeType":"image/webp"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
