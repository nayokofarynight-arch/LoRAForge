They were later mentioned and shown in a flashback during one of their labyrinth raids and how Kygras nearly died during said raid. It was then that the hero’s party was dispanded by the church as by that point, they had failed their fourth quest which in turned forced the church to revoke Kygras’s title as the hero.\n\nLilia and Lily would later reunite and join Rud in his hometown Avancia and from that point on continue to journey with him and Nin.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAppearance\nLilia has the same face and hair color as her twin sister Lily, the only difference being that she has blue eyes while her sisters’ is red as well as the fact that Lilia ties her hair into a ponytail. They also wear the same type of clothing that was provided to them by the guild, the only difference being that the gem on their neckwear matches their eye color.\n\nWhen Lilia and Lily combine together they become Lilialy, when merged Lilia takes control most of the time.
