Lilia along with her sister Lily were introduced at the beginning of the series with the soon-to-be former hero Kygras, who watched as he kicked Rud out of their party and both of them bid him farewell before departing with Kygras. They were later mentioned and shown in a flashback during one of their labyrinth raids and how Kygras nearly died during said raid. It was then that the hero’s party was dispanded by the church as by that point, they had failed their fourth quest which in turned forced the church to revoke Kygras’s title as the hero.

Lilia and Lily would later reunite and join Rud in his hometown Avancia and from that point on continue to journey with him and Nin.

Appearance
Lilia has the same face and hair color as her twin sister Lily, the only difference being that she has blue eyes while her sisters’ is red as well as the fact that Lilia ties her hair into a ponytail. They also wear the same type of clothing that was provided to them by the guild, the only difference being that the gem on their neckwear matches their eye color.

When Lilia and Lily combine together they become Lilialy, when merged Lilia takes control most of the time. Which is why Lilia’s appearance remains, the only thing that changes it that Lilia has a one blue eye and one red eye as she and sister have different eye colors.

Personality
Lilia is shown to be more confident and brash than her sister and seen fighting more often than Lily. She has a stern but caring personality and is very protective of her sister, as in the past the two of them had been abused by their parents. This motivated Lilia to protect her sister from suspicious people especially men.

Lilia is also shown to have a sister complex and does not mind Lily clinging on to her, whenever she feels like it.

Abilities/Skills
Fusion, A skill that when used causes Lilia and her twin sister Lily to fuse into a single form named Lilialy. It shown that for most of the series Lilia had taken control whenever they fused into Lilialy, which is why her appearance is shown when they merge together.
