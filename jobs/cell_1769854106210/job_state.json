Vegeta follows suit during the Shadow Dragon Saga, and their fusion Gogeta is shown wielding it not long afterward.\n\nThe incarnation of the form appearing in Dragon Ball Daima is the successor to the third transformation. It debuted in the final battle with Gomah,[8] having previously been achieved by Goku during his training after the defeat of Majin Buu.[9]\n\n\nContents\n1\tOverview\n1.1\tConcept and Creation\n1.2\tAppearance\n1.3\tUsage and Power\n2\tVariations and Enhancement\n2.1\tSuper Full Power\n2.1.1\tLimit Breaker\n2.1.2\tBroly\n2.2\tDark Corrupted\n2.3\tDark Gogeta\n2.4\tSuper Saiyan 4 Kaio-ken\n2.5\tDark Dragon Ball Enhancement\n2.6\tUltra Fusion\n3\tVideo Game Appearances\n4\tTrivia\n5\tGallery\n6\tReferences\n7\tSite Navigation\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWho are the characters that can transform into Super Saiyan 4?toggle section\nWhat is the difference between Super Saiyan 4 and the standard Super Saiyan forms?toggle section\nHow did Goku first achieve the Super Saiyan 4 transformation?toggle section\nWhat is the role of the Great Ape in the Super Saiyan 4 transformation?toggle section\nHow did Vegeta achieve the Super Saiyan 4 transformation?toggle section\n\nAdvertisement\nOverview\nFor a Saiyan to attain the Dragon Ball GT version of the form, they must be able to transform into a Golden Great Ape (the Super Saiyan version of a Great Ape) and subsequently regain conscious control over their form. In Dragon Ball GT, it is declared that the transformation cannot be accessed at will and requires exposure to Blutz Waves each time the user wishes to transform (Goku apparently being a special case as he is capable of transforming freely).[10][11] However in all other instances this proves to not be the case.\n\nBroly is capable of using his unique version of Super Saiyan, Legendary Super Saiyan, to transcend Great Ape and become a Legendary Super Saiyan-type Great Ape, matching the transformation criteria to achieve a \"Legendary Super Saiyan 4\". Hybrid Saiyans can also achieve Super Saiyan 4 without tails, as shown by Gohan in Dragon Ball Heroes.\n\nThe GT version of the form is a combination of the Super Saiyan and Great Ape forms attained through the Golden Great Ape form, it gifts the Saiyan with primal power,[12] though they retain a humanoid appearance. It is possibly the Legendary Super Saiyan that appears once every 1,000 years.[13]\n\n\"You know, it's funny. When I'm at this power level, it's hard for me to listen to reason. You see, I just lose control!\"\n— Goku in \"Saying Goodbye\"\n\nThis form gives the user the super strength and speed of a Great Ape, but with a calm, clever mind. But for others, it can make them very cold and aggressive.[6] A user of this form loses some of their rationality, at least according to Goku.[14]\n\nIn Dragon Ball GT, the form's power is too great to be utilized by a child and so a child user is aged into an adult when using it. The form possesses all of the power of Golden Great Ape.[15] This does not apply in Dragon Ball Daima.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nConcept and Creation\nThe original Dragon Ball GT incarnation of the Super Saiyan 4 form was designed by Toei Animation's character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru,[7] while the Dragon Ball Daima version was designed by Akira Toriyama.[16][17][18]\n\nAppearance\nVegeta's Super Saiyan 4 form\nVegeta's Super Saiyan 4 form\n\nIn this form, the Saiyan's hair remains its natural color is lengthened. To which, it becomes wilder, reaching down to the middle of their back, while two long pointed bangs of hair appear on both sides of the neck. They also become covered in fur from their shoulders' down, apart from their pectorals, most of their abdomen, and their hands. The fur color differs, the same goes for the tail, which becomes noticeably longer. A Saiyan in this form also possesses a shadow trim around their eyes and over the eyelids that varies in color, such as crimson. The individual is considerably larger in height and muscularity, as shown by Vegeta when his time limit ended, and he reverted to his considerably smaller size. Likewise, a Saiyan who didn't naturally have a tail before entering this form will gain one, only for it to disappear once leaving this form.\n\nThe aura in this form loses the arcs of electricity, once again shaped and colored like a regular Super Saiyan's smooth aura, (although in various video games, the aura was depicted as reddish with a small yellowish glow and sparks of bioelectricity). Most games depict the aura as the standard gold.\n\nIn the case of Gogeta, the coloration of the aforementioned features seemingly switches, as Gogeta's hair became scarlet whereas his fur became oxblood and the trim around his eyes are black instead of red. His aura also has yellow sparkles to it.\n\nFor Broly, his Super Saiyan 4 form is much like that of Goku's, though because he is using Legendary Super Saiyan 4, he retains the massively oversized muscles and lack of pupils his standard Legendary form possesses.\n\nMini Goku as a Super Saiyan 4\nMini Goku as a Super Saiyan 4\n\nGoku as a Super Saiyan 4\nGoku as a Super Saiyan 4\n\nIn Dragon Ball Daima, Goku's Super Saiyan 4 form has a similar design with a few notable differences. Unlike in Dragon Ball GT, the user does not need to first become a Golden Great Ape and then regain control of themselves. Instead, it is accessible by unlocking a deeper realm of power inside oneself. Also, it does not forcibly age them up into an adult state when in usage. Appearance wise, Goku's hair and fur are crimson (with his hair being slightly darker), the fur on the arms only reaches down to the forearms, and the fur on his chest has small, pointed portions over the pecs and covers more of the abdomen. His irises are red, his eye trim is black, and he sometimes displays a white, skin-tight aura when not flaring his primary aura. Additionally, he becomes significantly taller and bulkier, and his arms become noticeably longer while his forearms and hands become enlarged, allowing him to effectively run on all fours.\n\nA comparison of the Daima and GT incarnations of Super Saiyan 4 in Xenoverse 2\nA comparison of the Daima and GT incarnations of Super Saiyan 4 in Xenoverse 2\n\nWhile using this form, the user's upper body clothing will burst open to expose their chest, except if the user is female, in which case only their outermost layer of clothing will disappear. However, upper body clothing that can adjust to the size of a Great Ape such as Gogeta's Metamoran vest (as the clothing is byproduct of the Fusion Dance) or Broly's necklace (which is seemingly designed to change size like Battle Armor) will remain upon achieving Super Saiyan 4, except for Battle Armor, which disappears just like other upper body clothing, as shown by Bardock, Xeno Bardock, and Xeno Vegeta. The form apparently has a seemingly magical ability to restore the wearer's bottom clothing (in a manner reminiscent of Magic Materialization or clothing produced by the Fusion Dance) even if it had been destroyed as a result of transforming into a Great Ape and/or Golden Great Ape beforehand to achieve Super Saiyan 4. This happens to both Goku and Vegeta (due to the Saiyan Prince wearing Earthling attire in GT). In Dragon Ball Daima, this initially happens to Mini Goku when he first transforms and gets forcibly detransformed,[8] but after returning to his adult form, he removes his gi himself before the transformation.[19]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nUsage and Power\n\"Light breaks the darkness! This form is my instrument - I have no limits.\"\n— Goku in \"Baby Put To Rest\"\n\nGolden Great Ape Goku in the process of transforming\nGolden Great Ape Goku in the process of transforming\n\nThe original version of the Super Saiyan 4 form that debuted in Dragon Ball GT is a condensed version of the Great Ape's power,[20] drawing the power of its user up to its utmost limits.[7] This form is further stated by Old Kai to awaken the dormant power of the user. [21] This is reminiscent of the Ultimate transformation utilized by Gohan.[13] While Goku's Super Saiyan 3 form was unable to even faze Baby Vegeta, as soon as Goku transformed into a Super Saiyan 4, becoming an adult once more in the process, their roles in power became polar opposites, with Baby Vegeta being almost unable to hurt Goku. At the time of its debut, Super Saiyan 4 was the mightiest form in the entire series.[22] However, it is noted that Vegito may have been even stronger than Super Saiyan 4.[23]\n\nThis transformation allows users to utilize more powerful signature techniques. For example, Goku develops an attack he calls the 10x Kamehameha, as it is ten times (10x) stronger than the Super Kamehameha, Gogeta uses a powerful combined attack named 100x Big Bang Kamehameha in video games, and Broly has an attack named Gigantic Destruction. Despite this, the user can still perform the regular variants of their signature techniques if they so wished.\n\nLike the Super Saiyan God form, this form also seems to allow the user to absorb energy attacks. However, unlike Super Saiyan God, the Super Saiyan 4 form does not use up the user's power when absorbing energy attacks. This is shown when Goku absorbs Golden Great Ape Baby's Revenge Death Ball Final and turns it into a 10x Kamehameha.\n\nSuper Saiyan 4 also enhances the user's Saiyan Power ability in seemingly real time as during Goku's battle against Eis Shenron he was frozen solid by the Shadow Dragon, requiring Nuova Shenron's aid to escape. Afterwards, however, Goku adapted to and became completely unaffected by Eis Shenron's next usage of the attack as he instantly broke free while completely unfazed from the event. To which, Goku noted firmly that the same technique does not work twice on him. Later, against Syn Shenron, despite being blinded by Eis, once recharged by the other Saiyans' ki, Goku adapted so completely from Syn's previous assault that just using his other senses let him react to all of the Shadow Dragon's attacks effortlessly.\n\nUnlike the Super Saiyan 3's strain due to the utilization in ki, this form does not require as much energy to maintain as Super Saiyan 3, allowing the user to stay in the state at a much longer duration. Although the form doesn't require much energy to use or maintain, the user can still fall out of the form if they run low, similar to Super Saiyan 3.[24] And while its ki consumption does not strain the user themselves, it does become straining when used in conjunction with Fusion Dance, significantly shortening the fusion time limit; as evidenced by Gogeta defusing within ten minutes instead of the regular half-hour limit.\n\nIn the Xenoverse series, both Beerus and Whis note the form to possess amazing power, and Goku, Vegeta, and Gogeta think that the form might be able to surpass Beerus. Whis considers it powerful enough to ask Goku if he would be willing to become a God of Destruction.\n\nPower-wise, Super Saiyan 4 is often compared to Super Saiyan Blue in Dragon Ball Heroes media. In the Prison Planet Saga, Super Saiyan 4 Xeno Goku proves to be able to battle Super Saiyan Blue Goku evenly in the manga and anime, however, in the game, Xeno Goku is defeated and has to catch his breath after the battle, while Goku does not, with Xeno Goku noting that Goku is a step above him in power.[25] In the anime, Xeno Vegito manages to fight on par with Super Saiyan 3 Cumber using this form, seemingly indicating that he was more powerful than Super Saiyan Blue Vegito - who could only clash evenly with base Cumber amplified with the Kaio-ken, while in the manga Super Saiyan 4 Xeno Vegito appeared to be the weaker of the two versions of Vegito, as he was the one who could only clash evenly with base Cumber. Much later, during their last fight at the end of the manga version of the Supreme Kai of Time Saga, using this form Xeno Goku proves once again to be able to fight on par with Goku in his godly transformations.\n\nIn the Xenoverse 2 Extra Pack 2 Story Mode, thanks to Fu altering and messing around with the timelines, a post Tournament of Power Goku as your partner meets Vegeta and himself while they are training in Whis' arena of godly ki, both of whom are being manipulated by Fu. Vegeta opts to battle the Future Warrior as the concept of two Kakarots annoys him. During the fight, Fu begins to flood Goku and Vegeta with Blutz Waves and turns them into Super Saiyan 4, much to Elder Kai's dismay, to which the Goku working with the Time Patrol responds with Super Saiyan Blue and feels compelled to fight himself who is using a form he does not even know about. During the fight, it is also implied that Super Saiyan 4 Goku (whose Super Saiyan state possessed the mastered energy of a god and was close to awakening Super Saiyan Blue) has comparable power to Super Saiyan Blue Goku (from the Tournament of Power), with Super Saiyan 4 Goku having the advantage in power. However, both he and Vegeta inevitably lose the battle.\n\nIn the English version of a Gohan and Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta post-match quote of Dragon Ball FighterZ, Gohan states he has never seen anything as powerful as Super Saiyan 4.[26] This is not in the original Japanese version.[27]\n\nThis form is a transformation from Golden Great Ape, achieved when a Golden Great Ape has achieved a \"human heart\" - causing the birth of this form, which has both the tremendous power of the Golden Great Ape and the reasoning of a \"human heart\".[7] Unlike the main Super Saiyan forms, a user of this form will always appear as an adult,[7] this is because this form raises the power of the user to their prime physical condition, the user will not only appear as an adult but also look considerably younger, similar to the way they did during their prime years, (e.g., Goku's skin turning back into its original peach color, Vegeta's hair becoming the iconic flame-like appearance he always sported through his prime years).\n\nSuper Saiyan 4 Mini Goku trounces Gomah\nSuper Saiyan 4 Mini Goku trounces Gomah\n\nPrior to Dragon Ball Daima, Goku's Super Saiyan 4 form was achieved as a result of his intense training following the defeat of Majin Buu, although prior to Neva unlocking his power Goku wasn't sure it could be done.[9] In the Daima Saga of Dragon Ball Daima, after even Super Saiyan 3 proves futile in defeating Evil Third Eye Gomah, Mini Goku is left nearly unconscious from his injuries. Before Gomah can deal the finishing blow, however, Neva steps in and awakens Goku's power, causing him to awaken the Super Saiyan 4 form, engulfing the entire arena in his aura. In this state, he holds the advantage against Evil Third Eye Gomah in battle, forcing the Supreme Demon King to draw upon more power from the Evil Third Eye and grow to an even more gargantuan size. The tables are then turned against Goku, who is trapped in a magic sphere and drained of energy until he is left in his base form once again.[8]\n\nSuper Saiyan 4 Goku gathering energy\nSuper Saiyan 4 Goku gathering energy\n\nLater, after being returned to adulthood by Glorio's wish, Goku decides to fight Gomah solo to buy Piccolo time to land a sneak attack to remove the Evil Third Eye. In a marvelous display of power, Goku assumes his Super Saiyan transformations one by one, before warning Gomah that he wields \"one more bonus\". Discarding the top of his gi, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan 4 once again, sending a geyser of turbulent energy that shakes the entire Demon Realm.[19] With his true power on full display, Goku maintains an advantage over the giant Gomah despite the latter receiving near-endless stamina and regeneration from the Evil Third Eye. After flinging Gomah around, Goku charges up a mighty Transcendent Power Kamehameha that pierces through Gomah's energy blast, Gomah himself, and the Demon Worlds, leaving the wizard vulnerable. Goku and Piccolo's plan is nearly foiled when Gomah thwarts Piccolo's attempt at the third strike, but Majin Kuu ends up finishing the job, removing the Evil Third Eye and stopping Gomah once and for all.[9]\n\nGoku's Super Saiyan 4 form seen for the first time\nGoku's Super Saiyan 4 form seen for the first time\n\nThe Super Saiyan 4 form is first achieved by Goku in Dragon Ball GT after transforming into a Golden Great Ape and witnessing his granddaughter Pan crying to calm him down. In this new form, Goku has enough strength to dominate Super Baby Vegeta 2, whose attacks (including the Revenge Death Ball) have no effect on Goku in this form. However, after Baby Vegeta transformed into a Golden Great Ape, things are far more even but despite Baby Vegeta's new power (even gripping Goku between his hands Goku still broke out of it with minor difficulties). Eventually, the two have a double Knock-out. Baby Vegeta is rejuvenated by Bulma's Blutz Waves Generator, however, and Goku regains the full power of Super Saiyan 4 to face him.\n\nGoku's next opponent upon achieving the form is Super 17, who has easily defeated the other Z Fighters and proved to be Super Saiyan 4 Goku's first real challenge. Because of his energy absorbing abilities, Super 17 is able to turn all of Goku's energy attacks into his own power, making him stronger with each attack. Eventually, Goku reverts to his base form and kills the android (with the assistance of Android 18) using his Super Dragon Fist followed by a Final Assault.\n\n\"Ha ha ha ha... I am the prince of all Saiyans. I could never allow my reason to be overpowered by the primal mind.\"\n— Vegeta declaring his control over the Great Ape form in \"Super Saiyan 4 Vegeta\"\n\nVegeta (left) and Goku (right) as Super Saiyan 4s\nVegeta (left) and Goku (right) as Super Saiyan 4s\n\nSuper Saiyan 4 proves to be incredibly helpful when Goku uses it to take down most of the evil Shadow Dragons. However, he meets his match in Syn Shenron, the strongest of the seven Shadow Dragons, who absorbs all of the Dragon Balls and becomes Omega Shenron. Omega Shenron's power proves to be far greater than that of a Super Saiyan 4, and Goku is thrashed around for most of the fight. Seeing how bad this situation has become, Vegeta uses Bulma's Blutz Wave Generator to grow a tail and become a Golden Great Ape like Goku. When he finally gains control, Vegeta is successful in becoming a Super Saiyan 4.\n\nGogeta's Super Saiyan 4 variation\nGogeta's Super Saiyan 4 variation\n\nHowever, even as a team, Goku and Vegeta still stand no chance against Omega Shenron. It is not until they fuse into Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta that their power vastly exceeds that of the Shadow Dragon. However, Gogeta spends too much time playing around with Omega Shenron and the fusion wears off in ten minutes rather than the usual 30 minutes, due to his own tremendous power, ultimately failing to finish Omega Shenron off in time (but manages to land a Big Bang Kamehameha on Omega which made him regurgitate the Dragon Balls, reverting him back into Syn Shenron). Goku eventually kills Omega Shenron with the Super Ultra Spirit Bomb.\n\nDuring the Dark Empire Saga, Xeno Goku and Dark Broly both utilize this form in their three-way battle with each other and Mira (Towa absorbed). Xeno Vegeta later uses this form against Demon God Gravy, though is unable to take him down due to his injuries, at the same time Xeno Goku uses the form against Demon God Shroom but is at a disadvantage for the same reason. This leads to the two fusing into Super Saiyan 4 Xeno Gogeta to battle the demons.\n\nXeno Vegito as a Super Saiyan 4\nXeno Vegito as a Super Saiyan 4\n\nXeno Goku utilized this form for nearly the entirety of his appearance in the Prison Planet Saga of Super Dragon Ball Heroes, battling Super Saiyan Blue Goku with it. Xeno Vegeta also utilized this form for the entirety of his appearance and fuses with Xeno Goku to form Super Saiyan 4 Xeno Vegito. Xeno Vegito then battles and defeat Super Saiyan 3 Cumber before defusing back into Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta.\n\nIn the Universe Creation Saga, both Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta take on this form while battling the mysterious Dr. W while in Hell. Xeno Goku uses his Kamehameha alongside Xeno Vegeta's Galick Gun, but the combined attacks cause no damage to Dr. W who claims that his analysis on the two are completed. He then takes the data that he has received to Janemba.\n\nSuper Saiyan 4 Broly is fought by Beat and his friends in the Dragon Ball Heroes: Victory Mission manga repeatedly, and acted as a minion for Genome, who wished to access the Dragon Balls. He was powerful enough to defeat Eis Shenron, Nuova Shenron (true form), and Rage Shenron (Electric Slime Body Build) with minimal effort, and also easily take out Super-Class Froze and Super-Class Beat, as well as being completely unaffected by attacks from the latter's Super Saiyan 3 form. During instances where he is present, he is also accompanied by a thunderstorm.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nVariations and Enhancement\nSuper Full Power\nMain article: Super Full Power Saiyan 4\nGoku as a Super Full Power Saiyan 4\nGoku as a Super Full Power Saiyan 4\n\nAn \"ultra-full power\" version of the Super Saiyan 4, which takes its user beyond their limits.

Broly was implied to have achieved this form via the aid of Black Smoke Shenron in Jakku Mission 7.

Even if Gogeta is removed from Fin's body, he retains the ability to transform into his Dark Gogeta form, though the state is weaker if Gogeta is not absorbed.

During the fight, it is also implied that Super Saiyan 4 Goku (who's Super Saiyan state possessed the mastered energy of a god and was close to awakening Super Saiyan Blue) has comparable power to Super Saiyan Blue Goku (from the Tournament of Power), however both he and Vegeta inevitably lose the battle, even when fusing into Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta in some scenarios.\n\nIn FighterZ, as part of DLC Pack 6, GT Goku will transform into Super Saiyan 4 when performing Dragon Fist with one teammate down.

This applies to Xeno Goku as well.\nWhen Vegeta transforms, as well as turning it wild, his hair turns back into its flame-like appearance he sported throughout Dragon Ball Z.\nWhen transforming into Super Saiyan 4, both Goku and Vegeta lose their shirts, but when they revert to their base forms, their shirts can be seen again (however, Gogeta still has his vest on when he is a Super Saiyan 4). The clothes are even repaired; in the Super 17 Saga, when Goku attempted to sacrifice himself with Super 17, he reverted to his child state, and his gi was fully intact, despite the fact that it had been previously blasted off.\nDespite being in possession of Vegeta's body and able to achieve the Golden Great Ape form, Baby is unable to achieve Super Saiyan 4 as he was possessing Vegeta's body which had undergone Tuffleization. Though it has been suggested Baby Vegeta was impure due to the Baby's possession of Vegeta making him impure, it should be noted that Fin was able to achieve a hybridized version of Gogeta's Super Saiyan 4 form while retaining his Majin traits as his body is able to record the genetic data of his absorptions and Gohan/Xeno Gohan able to achieve Super Saiyan 4 despite being hybrid Saiyans. This indicates that Tuffleization and Baby's possession of Vegeta is what prevented Baby from achieving Super Saiyan 4 like Vegeta later did.\nIt should be noted that by absorbing Gogeta, Fin gains access to his genetic data essentially making him a Saiyan-Majin hybrid.\nGohan & Xeno Gohan are currently the only Saiyan-Earthling hybrids to achieve the form. They and Future Gohan are also the only confirmed Saiyan-Earthling hybrids to inherit the Saiyan Tail gene from their respective fathers (Goku, Xeno Goku, & Future Goku).\nHad the Super Dragon Ball Heroes developers been able to settle upon a hair color, Xeno Trunks would have been the first Saiyan-Earthling hybrid to achieve the form without ever having a tail. It is currently unknown, if tail-less Saiyan-Earthling hybrids or Universe 6 Saiyans could achieve Super Saiyan 4 through artificial Blutz Wave exposure as Xeno Trunks unrealized Super Saiyan 4 form suggests.\nThe Super Saiyan 4-like mental image that appears in Dragon Ball Z\nThe Super Saiyan 4-like mental image that appears in Dragon Ball Z\n\nWhen Goku first transforms into a Super Saiyan 3 on-screen (in Dragon Ball Z), there is a vision in his mind of him transforming from a Great Ape to a more monkey-like Saiyan, to his adult form, and finally into a baby. The monkey-like form bears a large resemblance to Super Saiyan 4.\nThe Wrathful form introduced in Dragon Ball Super: Broly is reminiscent of Super Saiyan 4. Both transformations utilize the power of a Great Ape without changing size, and by extension, causing the lumbering movements of the original form. However, while Goku and Vegeta in Super Saiyan 4 are conscious of their actions, those in the Wrathful state such as Broly become feral and uncontrollable.\nBroly's hair and eyes in his Wrathful state also look similar to a Super Saiyan 4's.\nHis unique Super Saiyan form is even closer to Super Saiyan 4, being a combination of Wrathful and regular Super Saiyan, just as Super Saiyan 4 is a combination of Great Ape and Super Saiyan.\nThe seven Saiyans to have reached this transformation in the series have shown differences in appearance among one another:\nGoku's variation of Super Saiyan 4 is the first to be seen. When he transforms. he gains crimson fur that covers his body. His hair becomes slightly messier and longer, with two spikes hanging over his shoulders. His eyes change to golden-yellow, with visible pupils. In Dragon Ball Daima, he has dark crimson hair and fur and red eyes similar coloration to Super Saiyan God. His arms become slightly longer while his wrists and hands become enlarged, and his forearms don't have fur.\nVegeta's variation is the second seen. When he transforms into a Super Saiyan 4, his hair notably turns dark brown, lengthening in the back and gaining two spikes over his shoulders. The fur on his body is bright red, and his eyes are green with visible pupils.\nGogeta's variation is a completely different coloration from Goku's and Vegeta's. In this form, Gogeta's hair is bright red in color, the fur on his body is a deep reddish-brown, and his eyes change to blue along with gaining visible pupils. The reasons for these alterations in Gogeta's Super Saiyan 4 form from Goku and Vegeta's forms are unknown.\nBroly's variation is also different. In this form, Broly has black hair similar in style to his Legendary state, but messier and with the telltale shoulder spikes. His fur is a blood red color. Broly's variation also takes on numerous traits of the Legendary Super Saiyan forms, including a much larger and more muscular body, and he loses the irises and pupils in his eyes.\nGohan's variation is the fifth seen. When he transforms into a Super Saiyan 4, he has red fur. His hair becomes longer in the back and gains the two shoulder spikes. His eyes change to golden-yellow with black pupils, just like his father, Goku.\nBardock's variation the sixth variation seen. He gains scarlet fur, his hair becomes wilder and slightly longer, and his eye color is golden-yellow with visible pupils. He also keeps his tail secured around his waist while in this form.\nXeno Vegito's variation is the seventh variation seen. While using Super Saiyan 4, Xeno Vegito's hair lengthens in the back and gains two longer spikes over his shoulders. The fur on his body is bright red like Vegeta, and his eyes are blue, the same as Gogeta.\nIn the Super Saiyan 4 form, Goku's voice is noticeably deeper and rougher like his Super Saiyan 3 form as an adult than his regular adult voice. Vegeta's voice is also slightly deeper.\nIn the Blue Water dub, Goku's voice in his Super Saiyan 4 form matches his regular adult voice. Vegeta's voice also matches his regular voice.\nWhen the part Saiyan-Demon Mira takes on his Final Form, his appearance resembles a tail-less Super Saiyan 4. His figure was also advertised alongside the Dragon Ball Heroes Super Saiyan 4s.[31]\nDuring the \"Future\" Trunks Saga, the Watagash possessed Barry Kahn 2nd Stage Heteromorphism form also resembles a tail-less Super Saiyan 4.\nMost Dragon Ball video games associate this form with Goku in Dragon Ball GT, with three exceptions, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3 has Z Goku and Z Vegeta utilizing this form instead of their GT selves, who is entirely omitted from the game and its story, with Z Goku taking GT Goku's place in the Shadow Dragon Saga. Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World has both Z Goku and GT Goku able to transform into the form, the only video game in the entire series where the form is shared between both incarnations of the character. Dragon Ball Fusions includes GT Goku, but his Dragon Ball Super self transforms into the form instead. In the Infinite History Saga of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, Goku in his Whis Gi outfit transforms into a Super Saiyan 4 instead of Super Saiyan Blue because of Fu's antics.\nInterestingly, when the Z or Super versions of Goku and Vegeta use Super Saiyan 4, their clothing changes to their GT attire, regardless of what they were wearing beforehand.\nIn the Infinite History Saga featured in Xenoverse 2's Extra Pack 2 DLC, Whis has some knowledge or knows of Super Saiyan 4.[32]","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"w8cndy1zv","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
