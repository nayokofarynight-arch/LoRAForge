Later, he is a sub-boss in Stage 5 and Stage 8. In each of these cases, two will appear in a multiplayer game.\n\nAbadede's primary method of attack is a clothesline at the end of a rushing charge. He will repeat this pattern. Occasionally, provoking him will make him pick the player up, hold them in the air in a standoffish position, and toss them away.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nStreets of Rage 2\nAbadede returns as the boss of Stage 4, in an underground fighting arena beneath a baseball stadium. He is immensely powerful, and his attack repertoire has been greatly expanded, augmenting his rushing clothesline with an odd uppercut, an enraged muscle flex to counter holds and long chain combos, a body splash that stuns, a clinch where he strikes the hapless player with a hidden wrench, and a back suplex that cannot be countered.\n\nHis variant of him, called Z Kusano, appears in the elevator gauntlet section at Stage 8.\n\nStreets of Rage 4\nHis boss fight from Streets of Rage 2 appears in a hidden retro level at Stage 5. In the Mr. X Nightmare DLC, both his original Streets of Rage and Streets of Rage 2 versions appear as bosses in Survival Mode.\n\nAppearance\nAbadede has a long mullet and sports face paint, and is dressed in red spandex wrestling briefs, wrist bands, and knee-high boots. In Streets of Rage, these boots were mostly red, but in the sequel, they are only highlighted with red and are mostly gray. His wrist bands in Streets of Rage 2 are also much larger, covering more of his forearms and sporting studs.\n\nAbadede's unnamed variants in the first Streets of Rage swap out his red for green or blue.\n\nHis hair and makeup combination is a possible reference to the late WWF professional wrestler James \"Ultimate Warrior\" Hellwig. His use of two of Warrior's signature moves (the running clothesline and body splash) seem to further cement that this is very likely an intentional tribute.\n\nSprites\nStreets of Rage\nStreets of Rage\nZ.
