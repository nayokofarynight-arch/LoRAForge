She usually ties her hair into a spiked bun while on duty, using a light blue cord. Konomi lets her hair down while off duty or at school. Her hair reaches to her shoulder blades when let down. Befitting her status as a martial artist, Konomi has a lean, athletic physique, and a modest bust.\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\nHer Anti-Demon Corps uniform is heavily customized to resemble a martial artist's uniform - in particular, one worn by a Chinese kung fu practitioner. Her outfit consists of a double-breasted sleeveless jacket and black undershirt, and calf-length trousers. Her jacket has white trim around the arm holes, and red trim going from the neck to along the lower hem, while her trousers have red trim going down the legs. Konomi also wears black tai-chi shoes, and a light blue obi.\n\nWhile out on missions, Konomi wears yellow hand-guards to protect her hands and wrists in combat.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nPersonality\nKonomi is an energetic, passionate girl who takes pride in her duty as a member of the Anti-Demon Corps. As the youngest of all the Chiefs, she is respectful towards her senior members. She gets along well with her peers, both in the Corps and at school. Konomi takes training very seriously, and trains daily to keep herself ready for missions. She will request and accept sparring sessions from anyone in the Corps.\n\nIn combat, Konomi is relentless in the pursuit of victory, and can carry on fighting despite suffering heavy injuries. She has an immense amount of resilience, honed by her martial arts training, which allows her to carry on fighting as long as possible.\n\nKonomi also has an inquisitive side, as a growing high school girl who is still learning about the world and how it works. After witnessing Kyouka kiss Yuuki as part of her reward, Konomi became curious about how it felt, and was willing to kiss her fellow classmate to learn more.\n\nPlot\nBackground\nKonomi was scouted at a very young age and quickly rose through the ranks to become the youngest chief of the Anti-Demon Corps. Before that, she had trained under the previous 1st Unit Chief Riu Myouga as the Vice Chief, becoming one of her prized disciples and inheriting her position. She is also the only chief who is still attending high school.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Chiefs' Assembly\nWhen Ren Yamashiro calls for a Chiefs' Assembly after the Anti-Demon Corps has repeated encounters with the Eight Thunder Gods, Konomi attends the meeting, along with the other Chiefs and Riu Myouga. Once Konomi and the rest of the Chiefs have assembled in the conference room, Ren makes her arrival and the meeting begins.[1] The meeting starts with Riu announcing that she will be stepping down as Chief of the 1st Unit with Konomi taking her place. Konomi enthusiastically introduces herself with Riu telling the others that Konomi is her prized disciple. As the meeting continues, Ren brings up the topic of the Thunder Gods and the damage they have caused to the Anti-Demon Corps. She instructs that if any of the Units are attacked by the Gods, the Chiefs must team up to defeat them and Konomi eagerly declares that she will defeat the Thunder Gods. Afterwards, Ren brings attention to Yuuki Wakura, Kyouka Uzen's \"slave\", and informs the other Chiefs that he is necessary for Kyouka's Slave ability.\n\nSuddenly, Ginna Bizen interrupts the meeting, informing the Chiefs that an army of Shuuki has appeared. Ren orders Konomi, Mira Kamiunten, Yakumo Ezo, and Fubuki Azuma to deal with them and the four rush off.[2] Konomi and the others quickly defeat the Shuuki, and Konomi reports that they were just ordinary Shuuki. Ren then flies off to locate a group of terrorists who were controlling the Shuuki and she quickly defeats them.[3] After Ren returns, she quickly concludes the assembly.\n\nKonomi and Riu get a ride back to the 1st Unit dorm with Kyouka and Yuuki. The four discuss how, although the meeting was short, they will be meeting with their fellow Chiefs more often. They then discuss Kyouka's abilities as a fighter and Konomi expresses her admiration for her, asking her if she can train with her sometime, which Kyouka happily agrees to. Soon after, Kyouka drops Konomi and Riu off at the 1st Unit dorm and Kyouka and Yuuki return to the 7th Unit.[4]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Azuma Banquet\nRen calls another Chiefs' Assembly and Konomi attends alongside the other Chiefs. Ren reports that she is pleased by the results of the joint training sessions and orders that they continue them. Ren also asks Kyouka why Yuuki (whom Ren had previously \"borrowed\" from her) is not present, and Kyouka replies that he is still recovering from their training session.[5]\n\nBattle in Yokohama\nAfter Ren calls an emergency meeting, Konomi attends along with the other Chiefs. Attending remotely from Washington. Ren informs the Chiefs that one of the Thunder Gods has infiltrated the city of Yokohama and has been abducting young women. She presents surveillance footage of the Thunder God who is able to \"dive\" into walls. After the other Chiefs add their insight into the situation, Ren assigns Mira to rescue the abducted women and subjugate the Thunder God, and Mira selects Kyouka to assist her.[6]\n\nA few days later, Konomi attends another Chiefs' Assembly where the Chiefs discuss the resulting battle in Yokohama, which has caused a public uproar, and Konomi observes that Ren has a lot on her plate at the moment. Ren declares that they will make a Mato Emergency Announcement to better prepare themselves for the Thunder Gods.[7]\n\nAbilities\n\nAdvertisement\nOverview\nLike all other women, Konomi attained a unique power having devoured one of the peaches from Mato. As one of the Anti-Demon Corps' Chiefs, she is much more powerful than normal Demon Hunters and as such is one of the strongest women in the organization. Befitting the 1st Unit Chief, Konomi has the highest authority in the 1st Unit. A testament to her potential, the former Chief, Riu stated she has the potential to become Commander in the future, she was capable of defeating a Shuuki horde in the amount of time that it took Yuuki to transform into his Slave Form.[8][9]\n\nPeach Blessing\nBeast Power (金色形意拳ケモノチカラ, Kemono Chikara, lit. \"Golden Xing Yi Quan\"): Konomi's unique ability, which grants her martial arts which has the same characteristics as an actual animal fighting style, ranging from modern, prehistoric, and unusual ones, such as that of Yuuki's Shuuki-like slave form. Once either are activated, she is granted a particular enhancement towards her strength and speed, focused on the particular animal, to the point of being able to handle 5 far bigger and bulkier Shuuki in a matter of seconds.\n\nOutput Boost (出力しゅつりょく上昇じょう昇しょう, Shutsuryoku Jōshō): A particular move that allows her to amplify her power output.\n\n\nSupreme Garment (無窮の鎖スレイブ・覇は衣ころも, Sureibu: Hagoromo, lit. \"Eternal Chain: Champion's Garment\"): The Slave Form, which Yuuki entered after Konomi acted as his Master,[10] where he takes form as an armored garment bearing some resemblance to a samurai with features similar to Yuuki's base Slave Form and a black unitard underneath it.[11] In this form, both of their powers becomes combined into this state, making it possible for her to defeat Yumeji Shimomura in her Shuuki state, while bolstering her Beast Power.\n\nAdvertisement\nPhysical Abilities\nEnhanced Strength: Even without using her peach blessing, Konomi has shown impressive strength, with just a palm thrust she is able to throw off Yumeji away from a distance considering that the former Chief was enhanced by the Thunder Gods.\n\nEnhanced Durability: Konomi is incredibly tough, able to withstand getting hit by electric discharge and just getting minor wounds, later on she still manages tanking powerful hits from Yumeji who has transformed into a half-Shuuki.\n\nImmense Endurance: Konomi is extremely resilient. She ignores her severe injuries such as getting electrocuted and her neck twisted to finish her off and still manages to fight back, gets the upper hand and pressures Yumeji into transforming into a half-Shuuki form which makes the latter more powerful. After getting punched by a transformed Yumeji, Konomi is still conscious. She remains able to engage in battle after getting her arm cut off by Taikyoku which impresses the Thunder God.\n\nEnhanced Speed and Reflexes: Konomi is incredibly fast with swift reflexes. She can leap in boosted speeds to reach distances. She has impressive reaction speed in blocking and evading sneak attacks from a former Chief Yumeji Shimomura in which the latter is surprised at Konomi, after experiencing Yumeji's power twice, seems to have a grasp of its weakness and able to dodge it consecutive times. Even with her eyes temporarily blinded, she is able to retaliate against an attack that comes her way.\n\nEnhanced Flexibility: Yumeji noted that Konomi is incredibly nimble, the latter twisting her body in a way that her neck won't break and saving her life in the process.\n\nEnhanced Stamina: As the 1st Unit Chief, Konomi has undergone strict training for the position, affording her above-average, stamina and endurance. She could perform a patrol around their base on foot with Yuuki, while talking, then switched to fighting multiple Shuuki without showing discomfort afterwards.\n\nEnhanced Senses: Konomi has honed senses, through her battle with Yumeji, she learns to predict her telekinetic power's trajectory. Even with her eyes temporarily blinded by Koko, she is able to anticipate where her attack will come from.\n\nMaster Martial Artist: Having trained under Riu, Kyouka's former master, Konomi became extremely adept at martial arts. As her Peach Blessing is based around the concept of Xing Yi Quan, it could be assumed she trained in it too. Because Riu conceded her status as Chief, it can attest that her skills are at the point of being more than qualified for the position, as well as the Commander in the future. Konomi focuses on using a mixture of strength, speed, and flexibility to combat multiple Shuuki at the same time. During her battle with Yumeji, a former Chief with enhanced powers granted by the Thunder Gods, Konomi has shown tremendous skill and even her mentor noted her prowess in this art. Using her skills in harmony with her peach blessing, she can inflict serious injuries against the former Chief which forced the latter to morph into a half-Shuuki as a last resort to have a chance at defeating her. Even Koko is no match against Konomi when it comes to hand to hand combat despite having the advantage of being slippery and still gets ultimately defeated by her.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nTrivia","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"5x54a3h64","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"x2bnb2ipx","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"nl7j2dyqp","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"v3nlc2pko","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"x9nxpcerx","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"lghi9rzg5","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
