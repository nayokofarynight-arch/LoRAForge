Appearance
Jaku'un without her helmet and coat
Jaku'un without her helmet and coat

Jaku'un is a tall and slender humanoid Shuuki dressed with an elaborate trench coat with a flared up collar. In place of a head, she wore a black helmet.

Underneath her helmet and trench coat, she has the appearance of a young girl with long tied green hair while wearing a green leotard and a red necktie. On her ears she has three diamond shaped piercings on each side.





Personality
From what little is shown, Jaku'un is a polite and courteous individual towards fellow Hachiraishin, welcoming Shikoku and Jouryuu as she is the youngest of their group.

Synopsis


Powers and Abilities
Overview
Shuuki Powers
Medical Knowledge: As the designated doctor of their group, it is assumed Jaku'un is versed in medical arts. She is responsible for turning human into Devotees and their transformations into Shuuki.

Curse Placement: While unconfirmed, it is highly likely that Jaku'un is the one who cursed the Devotees she created with a sun mark. This curse is activated when a Devoted is defeated, causing the body to explode from within leading to death. The mark cannot be removed (not even with Transience), and even if the part of the body on which it is imprinted is removed, it immediately appears on another. The only survivor among the defeated Devotees was Yumeji Shimomura, who used her Peach Blessing to survive despite her wounds.
