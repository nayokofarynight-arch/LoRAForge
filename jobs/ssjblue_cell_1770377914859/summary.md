- **Story & Background:** 
  > O termo "SSJ Blue Cell" refere-se geralmente a discussões teóricas sobre a possibilidade de Cell, com suas células Saiyajin (Goku/Vegeta), alcançar a transformação Super Saiyajin Blue. Embora não oficial no mangá/anime, teoriza-se que ele poderia, devido ao seu potencial genético, atingir o ki divino. No canon, Cell Perfect exibe formas como o Super Saiyajin 2. 
Fundamentos de Cell: Possuindo células de Goku, Vegeta e Freeza, Cell tem a base genética para super transformações, incluindo o Super Saiyajin, Super Saiyajin 2 (com raios) e potencial para o ki divino.
A "Forma Blue": O Super Saiyajin Blue requer o uso de ki divino (God) combinado com o SSJ. Como Cell se regenera e evolui, a especulação é que ele poderia treinar para alcançar o nível Deus/Blue.
Formas Existentes: Cell Perfect já utiliza uma forma "Super Perfeita" (com eletricidade) no anime. 
Em suma, um "Cell SSJ Blue" é uma especulação de fãs e jogos, dada a capacidade de Cell de superar seus próprios limites genéticos.

Super Saiyan Blue (超スーパーサイヤ人じんブルー Sūpā Saiya-jin Burū), also known as Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (超スーパーサイヤ人じんゴッド超スーパーサイヤ人じん Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo Sūpā Saiya-jin), is a divine transformation and a transcended version of the Super Saiyan God form.

By undertaking godly ki training with a deity to wield the power of Super Saiyan God in one's natural state, a Saiyan may achieve a divinity-empowered base form, which allows them to use Super Saiyan Blue as the Super Saiyan version of Super Saiyan God and this form surpasses its predecessor in power.[12][13] While Super Saiyan God can be easily achieved through a specialized ritual, Super Saiyan Blue has no such shortcuts and must be extensively trained in order to be used correctly.

Saiyans who possess truly divine status can achieve Super Saiyan Rosé, a variant of Super Saiyan Blue (in the manga) or more simply a divine equivalent of the standard Super Saiyan (in the anime and Dragon Ball Fusions).

Overview
Concept and creation
For the film Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’, Akira Toriyama further expanded on the concept of the “Super Saiyan God” transformation featured in Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods by combining its power into that of a Super Saiyan. As the author explained it, and as Goku similarly mentions in the movie, the form is as the name suggests the result of a Saiyan with the power of Super Saiyan God further transforming into a Super Saiyan.

In relation to Goku, Toriyama says on Goku he made his hair blue to express how "by overcoming a certain limit he has become both strong and tranquil, able to keep his composure in a fight". And in regard to Vegeta, he adds that he gave Vegeta black clothes because he figured that maybe Bulma had modified his combat uniform to add some slight improvements. On that note, it was constructed by the Capsule Corporation development branch under Bulma's instructions. In an interview with Toyotarō, Akira Toriyama reveals that he was thinking about having the form be white, but then it would have color-clashed with the "next enemy", so he figured he should save it for another occasion.[14]

Akira Toriyama named the form "Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan" in his character designs for Goku and Vegeta.[15] The name Super Saiyan Blue is usually used in the Dragon Ball Super anime and manga, whereas the name Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is more often used in merchandise and video games. Despite this, the voice lines typically say Super Saiyan Blue instead.

Appearance
"So what is this? Super Saiyan with blue hair dye?"
— Frieza commenting on the appearance of the form in Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’

This form is nearly identical to the first Super Saiyan form, the only main differences being that the hair and irises change to a cyan to teal hue (with the irises being slightly darker than the hair). In Dragon Ball Super: Broly, the hue is more akin to royal blue, similar to Super Saiyan God SS Evolved, and the aura gains pink swirls. In the manga, the user has blue streaks in their hair in addition to the cyan. Compared to the Super Saiyan God form, the user's musculature is slightly larger than that in Super Saiyan God as it remains pretty much the same as in base form.[16]

In the manga, the state initially appears without sparks in its aura but gains them after Goku and Vegeta's training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber prior to the Tournament of Destroyers.

Super Saiyan Blue's primary appearance in the manga

Super Saiyan Blue boasts a vibrant, fiery, electric blue aura, as opposed to the blazing orange aura of Super Saiyan God. The aura surrounding the Super Saiyan Blue form also appears to be glittering somewhat, with small sparkling particles of energy traveling upwards within the flames, with occasional surges of electricity. If one inspects closely, a very subtle yellow glow can be seen on the outside of the aura as well. It was not directly stated why this is present, but it could be remnants of the original Super Saiyan transformation. This dual-colored aura resembles that of Future Trunks' Super Saiyan Rage form. Unlike the main Super Saiyan transformations, the user's body does not glow in Blue form without an aura. In Dragon Ball Super: Broly, this subtle glow is omitted entirely.

When the user first transforms, they are enveloped by an aura of white energy, leaving a dark silhouette of themselves in it. They are then surrounded by a shell of blue ki which cracks and breaks apart, revealing the transformed user within, before the fiery aura explodes forth. Most subsequent transformations behave like an ordinary Super Saiyan, in which the user's hair rises and turns blue.

In the case of Commeson duplicates as shown by Duplicate Vegeta, the form's eyes and hair glow blue though the hair's color is a more saturated shade of blue than that of natural Saiyans. As Commeson duplicates like Vegeta's lack facial hair such as eyebrows only their head hair changes color.

In Dragon Ball Heroes, the Saiyan avatars' hair do not change in shape when using this form, making it visually similar to Super Saiyan God. This also applies to Saiyan Future Warrior in Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. If a Saiyan is bald, they will simply gain a Super Saiyan Blue aura though their eyebrows will still change color as will any other facial hair.

Usage and Power

In Goku's words, this form is what happens when a "Saiyan with the power of a Super Saiyan God further transforms himself into a Super Saiyan".[3] Simply, it is the first Super Saiyan form combined with the power and godly ki of a Super Saiyan God turned cyan blue, due to a mortal absorbing it. The form can be obtained by a Saiyan who has become a Super Saiyan God and then retained the power; if the Saiyan utilizes the might of Super Saiyan God and then attempts to transform into a Super Saiyan, they will instead naturally evolve into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Super Saiyan Blue or Super Saiyan Rosé, depending on the individual's status). Alternatively, as shown in the anime and by Goku Black in the manga, the Saiyan can evolve their standard Super Saiyan form into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form if they increase its strength until it surpasses Super Saiyan God. According to Dragon Ball Z: Extreme Butōden, Super Saiyan Blue is the most powerful of all Super Saiyan transformations.

This form is accessed through the activation of its user's godly ki. The form pushes the user's power, strength, and speed to new heights beyond those of previous Super Saiyan levels, as well as providing a calm mind that make it and its ki easier to control compared to the other Saiyan forms such as Super Saiyan 3. The ki control of this form allowed both Goku and Vegeta to keep their new level of godly ki from leaking out of the form, unlike Super Saiyan 2 and 3, which only increase their power to the full limit and leak ki; this feature allowed Goku and Vegeta to maintain their godly ki without it being used to keep the form on, this is how Goku can push himself to Kaio-ken x10, and then later on x20. This allows them to fight within the form freely without ki drain and reserved for ki-based attacks. It is stated by both Goku and Vegeta that a calm mind and focus are required to use this form properly. The form's godly ki renders the Saiyan's own ki insensible by most mortals via ki sense, and only those who know how to sense godly ki can detect it. Despite the form's huge upgrade in power from the original Super Saiyan God, neither Goku nor Vegeta still could challenge Beerus alone, needing to fight together to be able to stand a chance. This form was initially not powerful enough to defeat Golden Frieza at full power either, but due to Goku and Vegeta's experience with the form, Super Saiyan Blue was able to outlast Golden Frieza thanks to its efficient ki and stamina output compared to his unmastered transformation. This form becomes stronger through training, as Goku was able to match Golden Frieza in power during their next meeting, even though Frieza was noticed to have become stronger himself. In fact, it is even able to increase its strength with sufficient amount of combat, displayed by how while he got easily beaten back by Jiren, the next time, Goku was able to match up to him and make him fight more seriously. Because of this form's perfect innate ki control and the calm mind required to attain it, this form can be combined with the Kaio-ken to create the Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken in the anime.

Despite its benefits, however, the Super Saiyan Blue form does drain a lot of stamina upon initially being unlocked. While not nearly as noticeable or potent as the Super Saiyan 3 and unmastered Golden Frieza forms, Super Saiyan Blue needs to be mastered via intense training or long-time experience, as Goku and Vegeta have. The form's stamina flaw is elaborated on in the Dragon Ball Super manga: If the form is subsequently used multiple times in a row, on the second consecutive usage the user's abilities will drop by over 90% from their full power, explaining how Vegeta was unable to overwhelm Hit like Goku could, due to Vegeta already using the form against Cabba. This stamina flaw also exists in the anime, although it is never stated exactly how much power the user loses. Goku admitted that Super Saiyan Blue required too much energy to start the battle during the Tournament of Destroyers. By the time of the Zeno Expo, Goku was able to repeatedly use the form and the Kaio-ken without drawbacks, but even so during the Tournament of Power Goku and Vegeta still felt that they never want to constantly use the form right from the start of the tournament, and Whis noted that the form still drained a lot of stamina if it was already used so early in the tournament, preferring to fight in their regular Super Saiyan forms and using the Blue form when necessary. The Saiyans bypassed this flaw by learning to instantly switch back and forth between Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue, moving around as a Super Saiyan God and attacking and defending as a Super Saiyan Blue - allowing for much more powerful and more concentrated attacks. In addition, the strain regarding ki becomes significant when utilizing the form in a fusion as demonstrated during Vegito's fight with Fused Zamasu.

In the anime, Vegeta is shown using this transformation again against Future Trunks, as he laughed when Trunks asked Vegeta if he would transform into a Super Saiyan 3. Trunks remarked that Vegeta and Goku should easily be able to beat Goku Black. As their battle continued, Vegeta was able to easily defeat Trunks. However, the aforementioned fight against Black turned out more difficult than expected. Vegeta and in the anime only Goku use this form while battling Goku Black, before and after he transforms into Super Saiyan Rosé. Despite their efforts, in the anime Black's improved base form (which previously fought on par with Goku's Super Saiyan 2) was easily able to withstand most of the attacks Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta dealt, and in the manga Super Saiyan Goku Black manages to match Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta thanks to being healed by Future Zamasu and receiving a power-up, and Black's transformation into Super Saiyan Rosé only made the situation more critical. In the anime, after training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and going back to the Future, Vegeta was shown to have increased his power through anger enough that in his Super Saiyan Blue form he managed to overpower and pummel Goku Black, who was in the Super Saiyan Rosé state at the time even blocking Black's Fierce God Slicer with his bare fist.

In the manga, by the final fight against Goku Black and Future Zamasu, Vegeta revealed the ability to utilize Super Saiyan Blue's full power, in short, instant bursts as he attacks. It is noted by Goku that in order to counteract the form's stamina drawback, Vegeta learned to transform into Blue for brief moments multiple times without his stamina dropping at all, something that allowed him to overwhelm Black.

Goku Black first showcases his equivalent of the Super Saiyan Blue form during his battle with Vegeta in the future; however, due to being an actual deity, his version has a bright pink and purple color scheme. He dubs the form Super Saiyan Rosé.

In this form, Vegito is able to challenge and even overwhelm Fused Zamasu, gaining an upper hand in their fight in the anime, and easily overwhelming him in the manga. In the manga, Vegito Blue's power is noted to be potentially greater than that of Beerus by Shin. However, before Vegito could perform the finishing blow, this form proved to be too powerful, and also strenuous, to be maintained and ultimately defused sooner than the estimated time. Due to Vegito using the God Final Kamehameha against Fused Zamasu, both Goku and Vegeta cannot transform into Super Saiyan Blue afterwards due to the technique's massive energy output.

In the manga, Goku primarily stops using this form in combat in favor of its perfected state following the battle with Zamasu, almost always only ever using this form as part of the initial transformation into the perfected form.

Prior to the Tournament of Power, Vegeta uses Super Saiyan Blue in a sparring match against Beerus prior to unveiling that he too has achieved the perfected version and from then on, he too almost always only ever uses the original form as part of taking on the perfected state.

In the anime, Goku utilizes this form again immediately when he begins his battle against Arale Norimaki, which also impresses the Android. Goku and Vegeta used this form again during Universe 6 and Universe 7's baseball match, and later when Goku fights Hit, who attempts to assassinate him and proved to be quite a match for this form - thanks to fighting at his very best using killing techniques, and with Goku unable to hit the assassin at all, because he was hiding in his Time Storage parallel world while he attacks the Saiyan using his deadly Invisible ki blasts, and attacking him by surprise once briefly bursting out of his Time Storage parallel world - the fight ultimately ended in a stalemate when Super Saiyan Blue Goku unleashes a massive aura burst, and then destroys Hit's Time Storage world without the need to use Kaio-ken, then launches a full-power God Kamehameha at Hit, with the assassin trying to hold his own against Goku's massive assault. Vegeta also used it during his training with Whis on Beerus' planet in preparation for the multi-universal tournament.

Goku once again transforms during his match against the giant Bergamo during the Zeno Expo, to the shock and awe of all the deities seeing him transform, with Khai feeling and stating the form's godly pressure, and Roh labeling Goku's power in this form as "power rivaling that of gods", Future Zeno called Goku "amazing" upon seeing him transform.

Later, during his battle against the Warrior of Justice Top, Goku used Super Saiyan Blue to escape the Pride Trooper's crushing hold, and then proceeds to briefly outmatch him using his form's godly speed, but Top defends himself and puts up quite a better fight against Goku's godly ki surrounded form. Goku unleashes a God Kamehameha at the Pride Trooper, while he retaliated with his Justice Flash technique, Goku then uses his Instant Transmission and gets closer to Top, firing the Kamehameha afterwards, Top blocks it, causing a massive explosion, but the Pride Trooper sturdily survived.

Goku transforms into Super Saiyan Blue during his sparring session with Krillin in an effort to test his true might, with Krillin feeling Goku's godly pressure, and Android 18 and Gohan noticing a large gap in their powers. Krillin charges his Kamehameha while Goku charges his slightly larger God Kamehameha, both fighters fire their beams, and a beam struggle is initiated, though Goku slowly gains the upper hand during the beam clash. Struggling, Krillin tries to hold out his own with his own beam until the struggle is stopped when Android 18 rushes in and kicks Goku's God Kamehameha away. Goku then used this form against Android 17 in their sparring session, having no choice because of his newfound strength. After his attempt to test him with a God Kamehameha, he started to trade blows until Android 17 stops the fight, not wanting to destroy the environment.

Later, Super Saiyan Blue Goku charged an all-out fist-to-fist clash against True Golden Frieza, once their punches made contact with each other, deeply hitting both their faces, they proved to be exactly on par with each other as both fighters were knocked out simultaneously after they briefly slipped past each other.

During the Tournament of Power, Goku turned into a Super Saiyan Blue to free himself from Nink's Bear Hug, easily freeing himself. When the Trio De Dangers charged their Triangle Dangers Beam, both Goku and Vegeta turned Super Saiyan Blue and overpowered the beam with a God Final Kamehameha, knocking the Trio out of the arena in the process. Goku turned Super Saiyan Blue to fight Kale who was in her "true form", an uncontrolled state of Super Saiyan. Goku then used his God Kamehameha against Kale but had no effect on her, walking through it. This form proved to be comparable to Kale's in durability, even after being grabbed in the mouth, thrown aside, and crushed by a slab of Kachi Katchin, Goku showed no signs of considerable damage. During his fight against Dyspo, Goku uses Super Saiyan Blue in tandem with Super Saiyan God, in order to maximize his speed and power. Goku also used Super Saiyan Blue to go through K'nsi's explosive threads, taking no damage from the explosions and easily overpowered him. Goku used Super Saiyan Blue to free himself from Maji-Kayo's grip and revive Master Roshi, and he was successful in both. Vegeta used Super Saiyan Blue when he broke free from the Evil Containment Wave seal and then proceeded to destroy one of Auta Magetta's ear covers and insults him.

After using all of his transformations (sans Super Saiyan 3) to test his strength, Goku used this transformation during his battle with Jiren. However, while he finally forced Jiren to fight back, even briefly pushing him back and making him choose to dodge his Kamehameha, once Jiren gets more serious, even Super Saiyan Blue, with its power multiplied by the x20 Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken, could not match Jiren. Vegeta later on uses this form to battle Top. Goku uses this form again against Kefla after seeing his Super Saiyan God form would not be enough to fight her, which she answers by turning Super Saiyan herself. He is ultimately overpowered by her and has to resort to using Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken to deflect her energy attack but was still not enough against a more serious Kefla, and was knocked out with a single kick to the neck.

Later on, Goku displays sufficient increase in power to be able to go head on with Jiren using only the regular Super Saiyan Blue even though previously he was outclassed using Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken, with Jiren even being impressed by how Goku had grown stronger. However, upon Jiren getting more serious, Goku is once again pushed back but he is still able to fend off Jiren's attacks more adequately than before, long enough to have the trap he had set up trigger and managed to kick Jiren off the rock he was standing on, nearly eliminating him.

Vegeta's performance was initially much worse as he could not even make Jiren fight back, completely unable to faze him, and once Jiren gets annoyed, he got soundly beaten, even with aid from Super Saiyan Blue Goku. However, after seeing Jiren use his Invisible Strikes, unlike Goku, who only could briefly defend before being painfully launched away, Vegeta was able to properly analyze and then counter it, shocking Jiren enough for Vegeta to briefly push back the strongest fighter of Universe 11 until Jiren recovers and swiftly beats him down and nearly eliminates Vegeta, although he was able to stay on the stage despite being battered. Although he was able to force Jiren to block with a Full Charge Final Flash, which astonished Belmod and Khai, he did no damage and was incapacitated by a Power Impact formed into a cage that electrified him and left him badly injured, though Jiren praised the might and was briefly knocked to the ground.

Later after being re-energized by Vegeta's ki, Super Saiyan Blue Goku could clash with Jiren using his full power for a time, but was easily beaten down to his base form with a single punch.

Super Saiyan Blue Goku vs
Super Saiyan Blue Goku vs. Granolah

In the manga, Vegeta briefly uses Super Saiyan Blue to blast away Moro's Fire and Flames but transforms into the heightened states almost immediatly afterwards.

Goku uses the ordinary Super Saiyan Blue once more to battle the powered up Granolah after his Super Saiyan God form proved to not be enough against the Cerealian. When even this proved ineffective, he took on the Perfected state to use alongside Ultra Instinct.

In the Prison Planet Saga, Goku uses this form to battle with Super Saiyan 4 Xeno Goku. In the manga, Goku and Vegeta immediately power up into this form when Cumber arrives and Vegeta continues to use it against Super Saiyan (Berserk) Goku, only to be at a disadvantage to the effects of his Evil Aura. In both media, Vegito uses this form to battle Cumber. In the anime Goku takes on this form to get Golden Great Ape Cumber's foot off of him.

Goku and Vegeta use Super Saiyan Blue against Perfect Hearts
Goku and Vegeta use Super Saiyan Blue against Perfect Hearts

In Universal Conflict Saga, upon arriving in Universe 6, Vegeta uses this form in the manga to knock Oren out of Caulifla. Later in Universe 11 Vegeta takes on this form when going to attack Hearts, but is taken over by Oren, resulting in Oren Vegeta taking on Strongest Form 1. Goku uses this form against Super Saiyan 3 Cumber, with the two proving even in battle. In both media Vegeta uses this form to battle Kamioren. Arriving in Universe 7, in the anime Goku uses this form to battle evenly with Super Hearts until the warrior uses his Gravity Fist, while in the manga both Goku and Vegeta battle Super Hearts with this form but are overwhelmed. Goku and Vegeta use this form against Perfect Hearts, though even alongside Jiren and Hit they are easily defeated and thus fuse. Gogeta uses Super Saiyan Blue and proves to be able to hold an advantage against Perfect Hearts, eventually defeating him, though in the anime needs help from Jiren and Hit when Hearts uses his full power.

In the Universe Creation Saga, Goku - and Vegeta in the anime - use this form to battle Beerus. In the anime Goku and Vegeta use this form to battle Turles and Bojack, who have been empowered by the Evil Aura while in the manga they utilize Super Saiyan God and Fu halts the battle upon seeing them turn Super Saiyan Blue as he knows his allies will be no match. In the anime, Goku and Vegeta use this form against Black Janemba and then later against Fu - who corrupts them. Vegito uses this form against Dark King Fu and (in the anime) Super Full Power Saiyan 4 Limit Breaker Broly.

In the New Space-Time War Saga, Vegeta uses this form when facing off against Turles and Cumber.

In the Supreme Kai of Time Saga, Goku uses this form to battle against Android 17 and Android 18 of an unknown space-time, he then goes on to face Super Full Power Saiyan 4 Limit Breaker Xeno Goku in an even battle.

Full Potential
In the manga, the Super Saiyan Blue form's full power only manifests for a short while (in the initial moments of the form's usage during battle) and then immediately drops to the Super Saiyan Blue's normal levels of power. However, the true full power of the Blue form is explosively more powerful than the ordinary regulated power of the form, and so both Goku and Vegeta strive to find a way to utilize it at all times.

Vegeta was the first shown to utilize the full power for extended periods of time. By training to remove the stamina flaw of Super Saiyan Blue he could utilize a trick which involved switching between Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue in an instant in order to release the full explosive power of Super Saiyan Blue in these instants. This allowed him to overwhelm Super Saiyan Rosé Goku Black, whereas previously he was the one who had been overwhelmed. Goku later reveals a state that always uses the full power of Super Saiyan Blue.

Super Saiyan Blue's full potential only manifesting early in its usage does not exist in the anime, instead, it remains at the normal level of power. However, utilizing the God to Blue trick is still a way of maximizing the form's power when attacking.

Enhancement
"You took my body... you took my life... then you even killed Chi-Chi and Goten... you're gonna regret telling me that, Zamasu! Cause now I'm mad... I'm really, REALLY mad! And now it's time... TO PAAAAAYYYYYY!!!"
— Goku attaining this state after finding out that Goku Black killed his family in "Zamasu's Ambition The Storied "Project 0 Mortals" of Terror"

Goku's rage empowering his Blue form
Goku's rage empowering his Blue form

In the anime, Goku and Vegeta managed to power up the Super Saiyan Blue form through rage. Goku attained this state after learning that Goku Black had killed Chi-Chi and Goten after stealing his body. This allowed Goku to overwhelm Black and Future Zamasu simultaneously until his anger passed, allowing Black to engrave this anger into his own power, combined by his severe injuries, gradually increasing his might and allowing him to counterattack against Goku. Later, Vegeta utilized the power of rage (at Goku Black harming Future Trunks) to improve his Super Saiyan Blue form's strength while in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, this allowed Vegeta to overwhelm Goku Black, although the latter used the same technique (angered at his weakened state and the inability to compete against a mortal like Vegeta) to further his power and created a scythe from his Fierce God Slicer.

Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta's rage
Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta's rage

This exists in the manga as well as during the final ordeal with Fused Zamasu, Vegeta greatly powered up in anger after he witnessed Future Trunks and Future Mai apparently dead on the ground. With this power, Vegeta is able to blow both Goku Black and Future Zamasu (who had morphed into Infinite Zamasu) into pieces with Gamma Burst Flash, but to no avail, since the mad Supreme Kai still regenerated after taking all that damage.

There are also several powered-up variations of Super Saiyan Blue:

Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken - By using the Kaio-ken alongside the Super Saiyan Blue form, Goku can increase the transformation's power. In the anime, he uses up to X10 during his battle against Hit and later up to X20 during his battle with Jiren.
Perfected Super Saiyan Blue Goku
Perfected Super Saiyan Blue Goku

Perfected Super Saiyan Blue - In the manga, completing Super Saiyan Blue results in the user being able to transform into a higher form: Perfected Super Saiyan Blue.
Super Saiyan God SS Evolved - A form achieved by breaking Super Saiyan Blue's limits. In the anime, Vegeta achieved this form by remembering his promise to revive Cabba and Universe 6 as well as desperately needing more power to battle Jiren.
Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Berserk) - The Evil Aura corrupted version of the form. Goku and Vegeta take on this state during the Universe Creation Saga after Fu uses Cumber's ki against them. In this state, Goku and Vegeta lose control of their senses and even opt to use wild swings and moves as opposed to their finely tuned martial arts skills.
Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Berserk Controlled) - A powered up state of Super Saiyan Blue where the user takes control of the Evil Aura. Vegeta attained this form after Turles tried to infect him with the Evil Aura.
Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Barrier - An enhanced version of the Super Saiyan Blue state utilizing the Saiyan Barrier technique. Vegito takes on this state when matched against Fu to avoid being taken over when he uses Cumber's evil aura against him.
Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Universe Tree Power) - An even more powered up state of Super Saiyan Blue attained when one absorbs the pure power of the Universe Tree. Goku attained this form in his final fight with Fu.

In the manga, Super Saiyan Rosé is the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form of a Saiyan who is an actual deity, while in the Dragon Ball Super anime, this form is the result of a divine Saiyan transforming into the first Super Saiyan form.[17] Its different coloration is due to the Saiyan being an actual deity, and thus naturally possessing Godly ki.

In Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’, after Goku achieves the Super Saiyan God form and absorbs its power, and Goku and Vegeta train with Whis and master their ki control, they can use this new transformation. Goku uses this transformation against Golden Frieza in battle. Though he is able to hold his own, he is unable to defeat the tyrant until Frieza loses stamina at which point he gains a significant upperhand, but Sorbet uses his Bad Ring Laser and mortally wounds Goku.

Vegeta steps in to fight Frieza and demonstrates also being able to use this transformation, which frustrates the tyrant, after the fight he loses his Golden form. Even though he won, Vegeta takes too long to deliver the final blow, and Frieza uses this opportunity to destroy the Earth, killing everyone except those who were next to Whis. After that, Whis redoes time to three minutes prior and Super Saiyan Blue Goku kills Frieza with a Dash Kamehameha before he could destroy the planet again.

In Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4-D at Super Tenkaichi Budokai, when Broly shows up in his own God form after Goku once more, Goku transforms into Super Saiyan Blue in order to compete with Broly's might, as Goku's normal state was completely overwhelmed by Broly God. Vegeta transforms into Super Saiyan Blue as well and joins Goku in the fight however, the duo in their Blue state was still barely a match, even taking out Vegeta when he jumped in the way of a blast to protect Bulma. However, when Broly was going to finish off Goku, he fused with the audience in response, creating a fusion more powerful than Broly himself. This fusion as a Super Saiyan Blue easily annihilated Broly with a God Kamehameha.

Gogeta displaying the power of Super Saiyan Blue

In Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Goku transforms into Super Saiyan Blue after Wrathful Broly overpowers him in his Super Saiyan God form, allowing him to maintain a slight but ultimately firm upper hand over Broly, even taking his attacks with little damage, until Broly turns into a Super Saiyan. While he is still strong enough to deflect Broly's Blaster Meteor, even Goku aided by Vegeta were overwhelmed to the point that they had to fuse into Gogeta to turn the table. In his Super Saiyan Blue state, Gogeta displays power more tremendous than Full Power Super Saiyan Broly, ending in a massive Kamehameha that nearly finished off the berserk Saiyan.
