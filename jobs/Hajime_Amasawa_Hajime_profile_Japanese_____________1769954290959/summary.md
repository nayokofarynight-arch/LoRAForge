Hajime Amasawa (天あま沢さわ 始はじめ, Amasawa Hajime) is a supporting character of the manga series Whisper Me a Love Song. She is a third-year high school student and the drummer of the band Lorelei.


Appearance
Hajime is a girl of tall, slim stature. Her expression is quite piercing, with darkly colored eyes. Hajime has very long hair, is colored a dark mauve, and is styled with a short braid to her left.

Hajime is often seen wearing her school uniform, and the typical vest.

Personality
Hajime is a blunt and candid individual, often presenting facts without cutting any corners. Although she doesn't seem particularly passionate or excitable, Hajime becomes quite intense when the topic is something she feels strongly about.

Hajime cared deeply for her late older sister, Kyou, and was willing to start a band with Momoka and Shiho to honor her despite not knowing how to play an instrument beforehand.

Plot
Etymology
The name Hajime means "commence, begin/beginning" (始).
Hajime's surname Amasawa means "heaven/heavenly, sky, imperial" (天, ama) and "swamp, valley, marsh, dale" (沢, sawa).
