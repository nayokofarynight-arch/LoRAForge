Some time later, her true identity as a spy with the responsibility of monitoring all of Blade's movements would be revealed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAppearance\nJessica, like Claire, has a lean figure and tanned skin with dark eyes and brown hair.[1] She was seen donning the academy's uniform, which consists of an ivory inner vest topped by a light pink coat draped over her shoulders with violet hems. A short, similarly pink skirt and dark velvet stockings, and a pair of black boots. Her main outfit is a white crop top that bears her curvy midriff, white short shorts, a left stocking on her left leg, a bandage on her right leg and sandals\n\n\nAdvertisement\nPersonality\nJessica is a beautiful young woman with a relaxed attitude. She does not mind being seen completely naked by Blade. She even lets Clay get a good look at her naked in the bath, finding his flustered reaction funny despite being oblivious to his feelings for her. She is usually seen hanging out with Claire or accompanying Blade, she is the happiest of the group and the funniest person Blade has ever met. However, under this facade hides her true compassionate and kind personality who always cares about his friends and loved ones.[1]\n\nPlot\nSometime during Blade's stay at the Low-Grades, Jessica befriended him (though it could be another misunderstanding by the former).[2]\n\nAsmodeus Arc\nSeveral days later, Jessica and Claire are at the academy's cafeteria, where Blade invites them to sit with him and Arnest; however, they disregard his invitation and continue walking.[3]\n\nPower and Abilities\nJessica is a top level fighter, her specialty being the use of her cutting wind fan, which combined with her stealth often places her as one of the best fighters in the academy.\n\nShe was the first student to manage to activate her heroic seal thanks to which she was able to match the power of Blade even if it was only for a short period of time.\n\nRelationships\nBlade\nJessica1\nJessica gets \"serious\" about Blade\nJessica is one of the few people who know Blade's true identity, while working for the organization she had a mission to monitor him and find out how much of his real strength he has left. After failing in her assassination attempts and seeing how far Blade is willing to go for her and her friends, Jessica falls in love with him. Taking leaps and bounds in their relationship to the point where she managed to get Blade to promise her to have a night together (although Blade isn't sure what that means).\n\nArnest\nDue to the rapid progress of Jessica's relationship with Blade, Arnest often has her under surveillance, even more so after the two dates they had that ended up with Jessica and Blade in a love hotel. Despite all these they usually get along quite well.\n\nOn the other hand, Jessica really enjoys making Arnest jealous, usually calling her Blade's first wife and then throwing herself on Blade.\n\nClaire\nClaire is Jessica's best friend so they usually hang out together, they both know each other to the point of knowing the emotional state of the other with a simple look. With the passing of time, both would end up falling in love with Blade, something that Jessica finds wonderful but Claire doesn't like.\n\nLunaria\nJessica Bum\nJessica trying to seduce Blade\nLunaria and Jessica usually get along quite well, with Lunaria taking Jessica as an example in the art of seducing Blade.\n\nSeruel\nShe is Jessica's older sister whom she admires a lot.\n\nClay\nJessica and Clay have been friends for a long time, unfortunately Clay has never been able to declare his feelings to Jessica and added to the fact that she only has her eyes on Blade, has made their potential relationship end up cooling off, even more so with the arrival of Blifire and Mother, who are always by Clay's side. Despite this, Clay holds Jessica in high esteem.\n\nKassim\nDespite his behavior and often being beaten up by girls, Jessica considers Kassim a treasured friend.\n\nTrivia\nJessica's measurements are 87-64-89\nJessica is the girl Blade has gone on the most dates with and the farthest he has gone, having visited and checked into a love hotel with her, at the end of each date.\nBlade rejected Jessica's proposal to become lovers, this because Blade still doesn't know what it means or what he really feels for Jessica. Despite this, Blade and Jessica promised to \"mate\" in the future.\nDue to Jessica's rapid advancement, the rest of the girls have sought ways to advance their own relationships with Blade, especially Arnest.\nUnlike Arnest, Lunaria or Claire, Jessica often fantasizes about becoming Blade's lover, partly because of her character and partly because she enjoys making Arnest and Claire jealous.\nReferences\n Eiyū Kyōshitsu Light Novel — Vol. 2, p.(5) Data Graphic\n Eiyū Kyōshitsu Manga — Chapter 2 (p. 5), Blade mentions Jessica among his friends.\n Cite error: Invalid <ref> tag; no text was provided for refs named fear-arnest\nNavigation\n[ v - e - t ]\tRosewood Academy\n\nMore Information\nComments (0)\nStart a conversation\nSign in to share your thoughts and get the conversation going.\nSIGN IN\nDon't have account?
