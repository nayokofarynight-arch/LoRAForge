Biography
Slice is a tall and skinny muscular man with a mohawk, first seen in Jack's garage. He and his men were building a barricade to prevent the player from retaking the garage. However, the player comes with the Cadillac and breaks the barricade, running over the thugs, except for Slice, who escapes. By the end of the stage, they encounter again and fight, where the player defeats Slice.

However, Dr. Simon Fessenden suggested him to turn into a hybrid human/dinosaur to get revenge from the player, and Slice was mutated into Slisaur and cloned (there are two Slisaurs if there's one player, or three if there are more players). They retain the same abilities, weapons, and size as their human self, but with reptilian head, green skin and spikes in their heads and back.

The player encounters the Slisaurs in Fessenden's lab, where they fight again and Slisaur and his clone or clones are defeated for the last time.
