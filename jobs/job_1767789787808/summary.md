- **Story & Background:** 
  > Alicia (アリシア, Arishia?) is one of the main characters of the Clevatess series. She was one of the thirteen heroes killed but resurrected by Clevatess so that she can take care of Luna.
Alicia is a young woman of average height, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. As a hero, she wore a silver chest plate armor decorated with gold lining. Her helmet is also similarly styled with a golden visor and a pair of small golden wings on the sides. Like some of her fellow heroes, she donned a blue cape bearing the flag of Hiden.

After being defeated and revived by Clevatess, she retains her battle scars. She now has visible cross-shaped scars on her left leg (which was supposedly severed) and has lost her left eye, leaving her with a large visible scar on it that extends up to her forehead. It is also now concealed by a black eyepatch, which she took from a bandit during her fight with the Crows. Her current clothing consists of a sturdy long-sleeved tunic dress, topped by a fitted leather harness similar to a corset, which is connected to her brown belt.

To infiltrate the Solsein Magic Academy, Clevatess alters Alicia's appearance to make her look younger and have characteristics similar to the people of Hiden; this appearance doesn't last long as Clevatess returns her appearance back to normal later on.
From childhood, Alicia dreamed of becoming a hero, driven by a desire to broaden the world and see what lies beyond the horizon. Her ambition is balanced by humility and a deep sense of caution, having learned to conceal her true identity and strengths. Haunted by the trauma caused by Dorel, she struggles with fear but perseveres with impressive resolve.

After becoming a servant to Clevatess, she started to develop anti-hero characteristics as she refused to help the bandits who were under attack by monsters or angry townsfolks. However, she still maintains her caring side.
