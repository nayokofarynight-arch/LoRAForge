She was one of the thirteen heroes killed but resurrected by Clevatess so that she can take care of Luna.\nAlicia is a young woman of average height, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. As a hero, she wore a silver chest plate armor decorated with gold lining. Her helmet is also similarly styled with a golden visor and a pair of small golden wings on the sides. Like some of her fellow heroes, she donned a blue cape bearing the flag of Hiden.\n\nAfter being defeated and revived by Clevatess, she retains her battle scars. She now has visible cross-shaped scars on her left leg (which was supposedly severed) and has lost her left eye, leaving her with a large visible scar on it that extends up to her forehead. It is also now concealed by a black eyepatch, which she took from a bandit during her fight with the Crows. Her current clothing consists of a sturdy long-sleeved tunic dress, topped by a fitted leather harness similar to a corset, which is connected to her brown belt.\n\nTo infiltrate the Solsein Magic Academy, Clevatess alters Alicia's appearance to make her look younger and have characteristics similar to the people of Hiden; this appearance doesn't last long as Clevatess returns her appearance back to normal later on.\nFrom childhood, Alicia dreamed of becoming a hero, driven by a desire to broaden the world and see what lies beyond the horizon. Her ambition is balanced by humility and a deep sense of caution, having learned to conceal her true identity and strengths. Haunted by the trauma caused by Dorel, she struggles with fear but perseveres with impressive resolve.\n\nAfter becoming a servant to Clevatess, she started to develop anti-hero characteristics as she refused to help the bandits who were under attack by monsters or angry townsfolks. However, she still maintains her caring side.","quantity":75,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"h8ouefmvs","mimeType":"image/webp"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
