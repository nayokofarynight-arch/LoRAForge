Appearance
She has long, glossy blonde hair that always seemed to sparkle and gemlike green eyes.

Personality
Christiana—or Tia, as she was called—was from another nation, so she was unqualified to be an Imperial knight. In order to gain those qualifications, she’d have to graduate from at least two schools, undergo special training, and gain practical experience. In total, she’d be gone for thirty years.

She hates Marie and is always competing / fighting with her ( usually referring to her age and petrification as an insult).

She looks too deeply into what Liam does sometimes causing Liam’s great image in the head to grow even more revered. E.g. She read the budget for Liam’s patrol crew space fleet, for his mandatory military service. And believed he was developing it to not only weaken Barkley, by reducing number of traitors turned, but to also gain significant military influence, as there is a limit to the amount of power he can develop by himself ( while in reality he just wanted a cushy military service).

History
Liam saved Tia from the hands of the Goaz and his space pirates, who had abused her and destroyed her homeworld. Goaz changed her body into a monstrous creature due to his sick hobby of turning beautiful people into horrible beings, being quite relieved of learning of Goaz demise at the hands of Liam and begging him to kill her to put and end to her suffering.

Powers & Abilities


Equipment
Her outfit included a white cape, and at her hip, she carried a sword specialized for piercing—a rapier.
