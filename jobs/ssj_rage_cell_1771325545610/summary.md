Super Saiyan Rage (超スーパーサイヤ人じん怒り Sūpā Saiya-jin Ikari)[5] is an extremely powerful form in the Super Saiyan line of transformations, either an advancement of Super Saiyan (超スーパーサイヤ人じん Sūpā Saiya-jin)[1][4][6] or Super Saiyan 2 (超スーパーサイヤ人じん２ツー Sūpā Saiya-jin Tsū)[7][8] depending on the source.

An anime-original transformation unique to Future Trunks, its name is reflective of the intense anger he felt before assuming the transformation. All anime supplementary material simply refers to Future Trunks as Super Trunks (超トランクス Sūpā Torankusu) in this form.[9][10]

Appearance
"Trunks' energy is increasing with unbelievable intensity!"
— Shin shocked by the form's power in "Final Judgement? The Ultimate Power of an Absolute God"

During his first transformation, Future Trunks initially appears as a Super Saiyan 2, before temporarily but drastically bulking up in a manner similar to Super Saiyan Third Grade while shrouded in blue bioelectricity. Additionally, his hair spikes up even further than before (occasionally it still resembles his Super Saiyan 2 hair afterwards). Upon completing the transformation, Future Trunks' aura expands from the standard golden color to a dual aura consisting of an intense, light blue glow wrapping around his body within the original golden aura, as well as emitting particles similar to those in Super Saiyan Blue and Super Saiyan Rosé. Due to the unbelievable amplification of anger brought about by the transformation, Future Trunks temporarily had blank eyes as a sign of his near-berserk state (much like Pseudo Super Saiyan and Legendary Super Saiyan).

Future Trunks can also amplify his Rage form with a Spirit Bomb, becoming a special Spirit Bomb Super Saiyan. In this form, he possesses the same intense blue glow his original Rage form had, as well as an initially white aura that eventually expands into a fiery blue aura.

Usage and Power
"I don't give a damn about you, or your so called 'justice'!"
— Future Trunks before slicing Fused Zamasu in half in "Showdown! The Miraculous Power of Unyielding Warriors"

The Super Saiyan Rage form has ties to both Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2. Various media differ in how they designate the form, but the Dragon Ball Super Card Game refers to it as both forms.

When transforming for the first time, Future Trunks' eruption of force resembled a colossal geyser of golden ki that temporarily lit up the darkened sky and sent massive ripples of blue lightning across the desolate landscape. His power was enough to fracture the ground with every step.

The first time Future Trunks achieved this unique branch of Super Saiyan was during the "Future" Trunks Saga, after being beaten down by Goku Black and Future Zamasu's deadly combination and being told all of the suffering his timeline had endured was all his fault. Truly pushed beyond the breaking point and bristling with anger like never before, Trunks finally transforms into Super Saiyan Rage. The power of this form allows Future Trunks to hold his own against Super Saiyan Rosé Goku Black and Future Zamasu at the same time. When Future Trunks takes on this form, he first becomes a Super Saiyan 2, his eyes then go blank as his appearance alters to that of his Super Saiyan Third Grade, before a blue aura overtakes him and his muscles revert to their normal size, completing the transformation.

While he previously managed to outmatch Future Zamasu and catch Super Saiyan Rosé Goku Black off guard with his Super Saiyan 2 form (after training in the past), the power increase of the Super Saiyan Rage state allows Future Trunks to hold his own against Super Saiyan Rosé Goku Black. Later, he faces both Super Saiyan Rosé Goku Black and the immortal Future Zamasu alone, at the same time, and forces them on the defensive through a strategy to separate them.

Future Trunks utilizes the form to hold the two off by himself, while Goku and Vegeta travel back to the present in order to find a way to defeat Black and Zamasu. After being defeated and treated by Future Mai, Future Trunks uses this form again to fight the pair, knocking away Future Zamasu with a single blast and defeating Goku Black with a relentless assault. This form also allowed Future Trunks to have enough stamina to seal away Future Zamasu with the Evil Containment Wave.

While fighting against Fused Zamasu, this state is shown to be able to power up even further, through the energy of humans across the Earth, gaining a massive boost in power. This power was able to destroy Fused Zamasu's body with ease.

This form is very similar to Vegeta's enraged Super Saiyan 2 state, as both are massive power-ups to the Super Saiyan 2 form which temporarily blank out the user's eyes and are achieved through rage, however, the Super Saiyan Rage form involves utilization of the Powerhouse state in its usage, while Vegeta's power-up does not.

While Future Trunks does not use this state in the manga version of the storyline, he does appear in it on the alternate cover for The Decisive Battle! Farewell, Trunks!.
