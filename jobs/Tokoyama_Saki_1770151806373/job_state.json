Her hair is styled in a bowl cut with a single strand poking out at the top. She is shown to have a rather apathetic expression.\n\nPersonality\nSaki is a stoic girl who is very quiet and obedient, always following orders.\n\nSynopsis\nBackground\n5th Unit Training\nAs instructed by Ren, Saki, along with Yakumo Ezo and Kaiko Itsuki, went to the 7th Unit dorm for training with the 6th and 7th Units. After arriving in a large tornado generated by Yakumo, Saki was quickly met by Himari Azuma, who wished to learn more about her Bang Bang Bang ability, which Saki agreed to. The three Units then began a rigorous training session.\n\nOnce they are done, the members of the three Units relax in the hot spring, except for Yakumo whom Kyouka Uzen and Tenka Izumo have tied up in a closet to prevent her from groping the other girls.[1] As they continue to bathe, Saki looks around cautiously, with Kyouka observing that she is probably worried about how quiet Yakumo has been. As Saki and the others leave the bath, they are presumably accosted and groped by Yakumo, who was able to escape her bindings.\n\nAfterwards, Saki and the others gather to see the 6th Unit off as they depart. Kyouka then lends Yuuki Wakura to Yakumo, and he transforms into the Slave: Phoenix form. The two then fly off to test it out.[2] Later, Yakumo returns Yuuki to the 7th Unit and reports her findings, after which Saki and the rest of the 5th Unit depart.[3]\n\nPowers and Abilities\nOverview\nPeach Blessing\nBang Bang Bang (武装小町バンバンバン, Ban Ban Ban, lit. \"Armed Belle\"): Her Peach Blessing, which allows her to turn various parts of herself into real-life weapons and armor. Himari Azuma learns this technique at some point via her own ability, Learning; however, her skills in using it are not as refined as Saki's.\n\nTrivia\nThe name Saki is written in katakana (サキ), which has no special meaning. However, when written in kanji (咲, 咲希, 沙紀 or 早紀), it could possibly mean: 咲 - \"blossom\". 咲希 - \"blossom\" (咲) (sa) and \"hope\" (希) (ki).沙紀 - \"sand\" (沙) (sa) and \"chronicle\" (紀) (ki). 早紀 - \"already, now, fast, early\" (早) (sa) and \"chronicle\" (紀) (ki).\nHer surname Toko (所) means \"place\" and yama (山) means \"moutain\", meaning \"Mountainous Place\".\nSaki is the daughter of a hunter.\nReferences\n Chapter 52\n Chapter 53\n Chapter 54\nNavigation\nAnti-Demon Corps\n\nMore Information\nComments\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\n\nJust for You\n\nPopular Pages\n\nTrending Pages\n\nYakumo Ezo\nYakumo Ezo\nRen Yamashiro","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"7vjges7r2","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"5230e35cl","mimeType":"image/webp"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
