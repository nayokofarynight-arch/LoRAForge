Synopsis
Background
5th Unit Training
As instructed by Ren, Saki, along with Yakumo Ezo and Kaiko Itsuki, went to the 7th Unit dorm for training with the 6th and 7th Units. After arriving in a large tornado generated by Yakumo, Saki was quickly met by Himari Azuma, who wished to learn more about her Bang Bang Bang ability, which Saki agreed to. The three Units then began a rigorous training session.

Once they are done, the members of the three Units relax in the hot spring, except for Yakumo whom Kyouka Uzen and Tenka Izumo have tied up in a closet to prevent her from groping the other girls.[1] As they continue to bathe, Saki looks around cautiously, with Kyouka observing that she is probably worried about how quiet Yakumo has been. As Saki and the others leave the bath, they are presumably accosted and groped by Yakumo, who was able to escape her bindings.

Afterwards, Saki and the others gather to see the 6th Unit off as they depart. Kyouka then lends Yuuki Wakura to Yakumo, and he transforms into the Slave: Phoenix form. The two then fly off to test it out.[2] Later, Yakumo returns Yuuki to the 7th Unit and reports her findings, after which Saki and the rest of the 5th Unit depart.[3]

Trivia
The name Saki is written in katakana (サキ), which has no special meaning. However, when written in kanji (咲, 咲希, 沙紀 or 早紀), it could possibly mean: 咲 - "blossom". 咲希 - "blossom" (咲) (sa) and "hope" (希) (ki).沙紀 - "sand" (沙) (sa) and "chronicle" (紀) (ki). 早紀 - "already, now, fast, early" (早) (sa) and "chronicle" (紀) (ki).
Her surname Toko (所) means "place" and yama (山) means "moutain", meaning "Mountainous Place".
Saki is the daughter of a hunter.
