Nemumu is a beautiful, tan-skinned scout who serves as Light's loyal bodyguard. She acts as their primary scout. When operating on the surface, she works with Light and Gold as the adventurer \"Dark,\" serving as Light's personal bodyguard.\n\n\nContents\n1\tAppearance\n2\tPersonality\n3\tStory\n4\tRelationships\n5\tAbilities\n6\tTrivia\nlogo\n00:02\n\n41:20\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\nNemumu is an exceptionally beautiful young woman with striking, clean-cut silver hair that ends slightly above her shoulders. She has tan skin and almost always keeps the lower half of her face hidden behind a muffler, adding to her mysterious aura. Her overall appearance and stealth-focused role are often compared to that of a kunoichi, or female ninja.\n\n\n\nPersonality\nNemumu has a very serious and earnest personality, but she can also be inflexible and surprisingly dense at times. She has a neurotic side and is generally wary of interacting with people on the surface. This is due to the high standard of living in her home base in the Abyss and her constant annoyance with being hit on. She gives a 100% \"cold shoulder\" to any man who flirts with her and is repulsed by physical contact with men other than Light. However, after seeing her partner Gold achieve great success with his social skills, she has started to consider that maybe she should improve her own approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory\nThe Summoning\n\nNemumu came into existence when Light used his \"Infinite Gacha\" skill, manifesting her as a UR card with the title \"Level 5000 Assassin Blade.\" She was born to serve him as a powerful and loyal subordinate.\n\nLife on the Surface\n\nAs part of her duties, Nemumu accompanies Light to the surface, where they operate as the adventurer \"Dark\" alongside their companion, Gold. Her primary roles are to act as a scout and protect Light at all costs.\n\nHer stunning beauty, a common trait among women from the Abyss, attracts constant and unwanted attention from men, much to her frustration. This, along with instances where suitors tried to harm her companions, has led her to dislike interacting with surface dwellers.\n\nPersonal Growth\n\nTired of the constant harassment, Nemumu's default response to anyone who approaches her is cold and dismissive.\n\nDespite this, she is observant and recognizes the effectiveness of Gold's social prowess. Witnessing his success has planted a seed of doubt in her mind, making her contemplate whether she should try to become more approachable.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nRelationships\nLight: Nemumu is completely devoted to Light, serving as his faithful bodyguard. Her deep affection for him is so strong that she feels an aversion to being touched by any other man.\nGold: Gold is her adventuring partner in the unit \"Dark.\" She is impressed by his communication skills and the positive results they bring, which inspires her to reconsider her own standoffish behavior.\nAbilities\nDagger Mastery\nAbsolute Death\nSonar Detection\nPoison Resistance\nPoison Manifest\nTrivia\nNemumu is a member of the \"Ha-Ha Faction,\" a fan-named group of Light's female companions who are all deeply infatuated with him. Since she gets to accompany Light on small-group missions, her position is considered a special \"perk\" among the faction members. While the \"Ha-Ha Faction\" members all wish to kiss Light's foot, they usually hold each other in check. Nemumu is the only one who has ever been granted this opportunity, a unique privilege of her role.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"ebqvmgfju","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"w7rm0qr6c","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"rbuts6go0","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"imkxqhegz","mimeType":"image/png"},{"id":"u13tlk9fr","mimeType":"image/png"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
