Super Saiyan Rosé (超スーパーサイヤ人じんロゼ Sūpā Saiya-jin Roze) is a divine form that can only be accessed by Goku Black which matches Super Saiyan Blue in strength.[4][5]

In the Dragon Ball Super anime, as well as Dragon Ball Fusions, this form is the result of a divine Saiyan transforming into the first Super Saiyan form,[6][7] while in the manga and most other media, this form is the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form of a Saiyan with divine/godly status.[8]

Overview
Concept and creation
Super Saiyan Rosé was created by author Akira Toriyama as a unique form for Goku Black, though he simply stated Goku Black could "Become a Super Saiyan like Goku, and a Super Saiyan of a slightly different color than Goku".

Appearance
"Huh? Pink? Why is it pink?"
— Goku confused about the transformation's appearance in "The Zero Mortal Project".

Super Saiyan Rosé possesses a darker aura equivalent to the aura of Super Saiyan Blue.
Super Saiyan Rosé possesses a darker aura equivalent to the aura of Super Saiyan Blue.

In the anime, this state is identical to the Super Saiyan Blue form in all but color: Black's hair takes on a pastel pink color with faint white highlights, with his eyebrows matching the color of his hair, and his eyes change to light gray. The aura's shape is very similar to that of Super Saiyan Blue's with major color differences; it has a very dark shade of red on the outside, while it has a more pinkish color on the inside; while the aura is present, Black's clothing becomes brighter, while his eyes appear as pink and the color of his hair and eyebrows become a slightly darker shade of pink (due to him being illuminated by the aura) and he acquires a dark purple glow around his body. Usage of this form also appears to greatly alter Black's techniques, including his Super Black Kamehameha; while it has the same black color on the inside, the color is pink instead of purple on the outside. The color change also applies to his signature Violent Fierce God Slicer, allowing him to extend it into various more elaborate shapes. His other techniques also change their usual appearance to match the form's coloration.

In the manga, the form is differentiated from Super Saiyan Blue in the same way as the anime. The aura is more jagged and flame-like than the aura of Super Saiyan Blue. In a close up of Goku Black, his hair looks spikier. However, this is the case for all characters who are zoomed in on, and as a result, some have mistakenly stated that the hair spikes up and changes more than it actually does.

When Goku Black merged with Future Zamasu with the Potara earrings while in the Super Saiyan Rosé form to become Fused Zamasu, and later (in the manga) transitions into Infinite Zamasu, the result is a being who is constantly and permanently in the Super Saiyan Rosé form, due to fusions created with Potara Earrings automatically assuming the transformed state(s) the fusees were in at the time of the merger, and the resulting fusion being unable to power down from that form. In Fused Zamasu's case, just like Goku Black, he has grey eyes while in the Super Saiyan Rosé form, however, he has white hair, and in the anime, a colorful white aura in this form. Fused Zamasu's white hair in the Super Saiyan Rosé state was presumably inherited from his fusee Future Zamasu, who himself, has white hair.

Because Super Saiyan Rosé serves as Black's equivalent to Super Saiyan Blue, it utilizes godly ki; as such, it is theorized by Future Zamasu that this form is pink in color due to it being the result of a deity surpassing Super Saiyan God (with Blue being the result of a mortal surpassing it).

Usage and Power
"So this is what happens when a Divine being surpasses Super Saiyan God, instead of turning blue they turn pink."
— Future Zamasu's explanation of the transformation in "The Zero Mortal Project"

The January 2017 issue of V-Jump ranked both Goku Black and Fused Zamasu in this form as a 12/12 on the danger scale.[9]

In the manga, as it is a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, this state is achieved in the same manner as its mortal counterpart. Goku Black achieved the form when his power as a Super Saiyan surpassed Super Saiyan God, with Goku Black noting his divine soul and Saiyan body are becoming one. Goku Black then combined his divine energy with the first Super Saiyan form, evolving his standard Super Saiyan from into the Super Saiyan Rosé form.[8] In the anime, he gained the form by simply integrating Goku's fighting style into his own.[10] The Dragon Ball Super anime and Dragon Ball Fusions do not refer to it as a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, instead referring to it as the divine version of the first, standard Super Saiyan form. Thus, in these media, Goku Black achieves the Super Saiyan Rosé form by transforming into the first Super Saiyan form.

This form, like its mortal counterpart, provides Black with the precise ki control needed to properly utilize, and maintain, this form. Unlike its mortal counterpart though, the ki control of Super Saiyan Rosé is so precise and efficient (due to Black's status as a divine being) that this allowed him to create various weapons of energy at will. Unlike Super Saiyan Blue, which needed additional training to fully master it, this form somehow does not display any sort of stamina decrease. Goku Black is shown using the form as much as he wants with no drawbacks, possibly because of the combination of Goku's power which he mastered and the pure divine power he was born with, and all he needs to do is keep increasing his power in this form. In the anime, this form also appears to have no impact on the amount of time that Fused Zamasu can remain fused, unlike Super Saiyan Blue Vegito - who defused well before an hour had passed.[11]

In the anime, Black first revealed Super Saiyan Rosé in his battle against Vegeta, Goku, and Future Trunks. Black was assaulted by Vegeta as a Super Saiyan Blue and withstood his vicious assault before ultimately impaling him through the chest with his energy blade.[12] He then fought against Goku when he transformed into a Super Saiyan Blue; Goku was able to hold his own, but Black used his energy blade to pressure Goku. Once his ally Future Zamasu held down Goku and Trunks long enough, Black was able to take them both down with a Super Black Kamehameha, which the Saiyans barely survived.[13] In the Super manga, Goku Black attains this form by combining his divine power and his regular Super Saiyan form into it: by powering up massively due to recovering (and having Future Zamasu heal the damage) from a near-death experience, Goku Black's ordinary Super Saiyan form powered up and then evolved into the Super Saiyan Rosé.[8]

Black later shows off this form to Future Zamasu, to show that he does not require immortality, and his strength is already satisfying as is.[14]

Fused Zamasu possessed a permanent Super Saiyan Rosé state, due to Black having remained in this form when he fused with Future Zamasu via Potara.[15]

In the manga, both Goku Black and Future Zamasu are able to independently transform into Fused Zamasu, and thus possess this state. Infinite Zamasu has access to this form since the entity is simply a mutated version of Fused Zamasu.[16][17]

Under any normal circumstances, living in a permanent powered-up state of this magnitude would be incredibly stressful and would drastically shorten the fused being's lifespan; but, due to Future Zamasu's immortality, this problem may be not the case. Of course, it is ambiguous: after the fusion, Zamasu's body in the anime does not regenerate in the same way it used to, due to Black's body not being immortal; he also loses energy at a rapid rate, a trait caused by being in a permanent powered-up state. In the manga, however, due to Fused Zamasu fully retaining his immortality, he does not suffer any decrease in power and was capable of lasting long enough to undergo the usual hour time limit of Potara Fusions for those who aren't officially considered Supreme Kais.

Enhancement
"Now I've figured it out. The reason for the runaway growth in your power level compared to my own. It's anger, isn't it? Watching us hurt your son made you angry which made you stronger. So that's how Saiyan strength works. How primal. Turning your fleeting raw emotions into power! Only a pathetic mortal like yourself could thrive on a tactic that unrefined, which explains why it took so long to realize it! But if that's what fuels this body, I shall use my anger! Anger toward the mortals who defile the universe. Anger toward the other gods who have tolerated such behavior. And most importantly, the white hot rage I now feel toward myself... for letting you get the upper hand on me in our battle."
— Goku Black turning his anger into power against Vegeta in "Worship Me! Give Praise Unto Me! The Explosive Birth of a Merged Zamasu!"

In the anime, Black is able to power up the Super Saiyan Rosé form by using the alteration-type ki manipulation technique through rage, initally creating a new Energy blade called the Azure Dragon Sword Model Energy Blade. He later utilized his anger towards mortals to attain this state and used it to combat rage empowered Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta. With this power, his weapon forging abilities evolved once more as he created the Sickle of Sorrow, capable of - with some help from his Time Ring - creating a rift capable of spawning several "clones" of himself or in Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 can create time anomalies strong enough to summon forth entities with ki similar to Black's.

In the manga, Fused Zamasu can push his power in this form to the point where his body cannot handle it and thus take on a Powerhouse state, which Vegeta compares to the Perfected Super Saiyan Blue and notes that Fused Zamasu's body will be damaged from the overflowing even power despite his immortality.
