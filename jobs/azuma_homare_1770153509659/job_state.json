This, however, doesn't appear to be limited to Himari alone, as she threatened to \"lop off\" Maia’s head after she questioned who'd beat Himari, initially happening after she changed Maia’s initial outfit using Python.\n\nMost notable, Homare is shown to have a relatively quick temper, being first shown after Maia sealed her movements. It happened again after she purposely bumped into Himari before the Azuma Banquet, leading to her mocking Himari and calling her a masochist for returning. She also immediately targeted Himari and Yuuki during the Azuma Banquet, seemingly holding quite the grudge towards both of them. The cause of this is most likely when Himari slapped her hand away and proceeded to raise a fist to her face, finally standing her ground against Homare.\n\nIt is also later revealed that she had a strong animosity toward the members of the Main Family, vowing to take everything away from them. Her hostility towards the Main Family is fully displayed in her interactions with her three step sisters, especially during the Azuma Banquet when fighting Himari and Yuuki, as she tells Himari that she has the same gaze that runs in the Main Family, something she absolutely can’t stand.\n\nDespite her brash nature and penchant for wearing revealing clothing, she actually gets quite embarrassed in front of others while nude.\n\nShe is also a sore loser, as seen when she attempted to sneak into Yuuki’s room to seduce and steal him from Himari after they beat her as payback.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nBackground\nHomare is a member of the Azuma Branch Family, being one of the people who berated Himari for being weaker and less gifted than the rest of the family. She even physically abused her in the past, usually beating her until she cried.\n\nPowers and Abilities\nOverview\nLike most women who devour one of the peaches from Mato, Homare attained a unique power. As a member of the Azuma Branch Family, more so one of their most talented, she is a rather skilled and strong Demon Hunter in the corps. Since losing against Himari in the competition to decide the next family head, Homare has been training herself much harder than before in mastering her Peach Blessing, with Tobera stating that if she kept getting faster than she would have the chance to be the \"Fastest in the World\".\n\nPhysical Abilities\nMaster Combatant: Homare is skilled in armed and unarmed combat, used in conjuncture with her Python abilities allows her to match and outmatch Yuuki in his Whirlwind Form.\n\nSensitive Skin: Either natural or as an aftereffect of her Peach Blessing, Homare has rather sensitive skin, allowing her to precieve things more accutely than others.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nPeach Blessing\nPython (行雲流水パイソン, Paison, lit. \"Going with The Flow\"): Homare's Peach Blessing, which allows her to program the movements transmitted into her brain, causing her body to follows their pre-programed movements. Although, she is unable to change her movements after programming them, her body is strengthened in executing of her programmed movements, which is precise enough to allow her to remove and change Maia's clothing without her noticing. As Homare kept training, her speed kept on increasing, having sharp enough reflexes to avoid and zigzag around multiple trees without running into one.\n\nEquipment\nDaggers: Homare uses two daggers in combat.","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"hiencfdta","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"5xo89pwt3","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"j1kvg9a7e","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"r5sfxwatf","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"n0ro5grmi","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"bv7hz1e3q","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"yzmbysrir","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"kzmmwtxes","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"0tt6uv9aa","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"25wac87i4","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"tmx9zvvuc","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"o4wuqf6eq","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"iw4go5m3o","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"bm05q6waz","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
