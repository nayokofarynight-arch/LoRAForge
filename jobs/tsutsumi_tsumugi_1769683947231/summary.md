Noel Izumi
Tsumugi met Noel in the park where she witnessed her Yuki-onna powers, but despite their differences she quickly accepted her. Tsumugi saw Noel as a friend but Noel didn't due to not understanding friendship, she thought that if you are friends with someone, you cannot be friends with another person, Tsumugi was hurt by this and demanded that Noel explain why they are not friends. After Noel explained her viewpoint Tsumugi explained to her that her logic is flawed as she was friends with Shintaro and Towa, so she can be friends with whomever she wants, which made Noel really happy and they started calling each other by their first names. Tsumugi seemed to be a bit jealous of Noel's voluptuous figure in the bath but Noel pointed out that Tsumugi isn't small she is just right, Noel even offered to let Tsumugi touch her chest as she thought that was what you do in the bath with friends due to basing her interactions with friends on manga and anime she had seen.
