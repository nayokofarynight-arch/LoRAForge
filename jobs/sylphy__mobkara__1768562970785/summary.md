Appearance
Sylphy appears as a young, ethereal girl. She wears a white dress with blue borders around her chest and petal like patterns on the skirt, each tipped with a small blue gem. Her stockings and gloves are both white and edged with blue. She wears a long cape that reaches down to her knees, which is white on the exterior but a light shade of blue on the inside, and is also edged with a blue trim. Around her neck she wears a white and blue collar adorned with a blue gem. Her tiara, pauldrons, greaves, boots and armour are all silver. She has a pair of small wings that emerge from her upper back. Her boots are decorated with wings. Her hair is cyan, and done up in an odango style with wing-like accessories.

Personality
Sylphy is very polite and obedient to her master Kaito, although she is not above reprimanding him when necessary. She consumes monster cores to regain her magical powers, and appears to savour them like candies, especially the rarer ones, although she has shown a dislike towards bug cores. If she can assist Kaito, she will gladly do so, and if her assistance is lacking, she takes it as a failing on her part, but cheers up very quickly upon receiving praise for her actions. When Kaito levels up, she is quick to congratulate and praise him for having done so. Overall, she has a bright and warm personality, and has stated that she is 'thrilled' that Kaito is her master. She also appears to hold some degree of romantic affection for Kaito.

She appears to have a phobia of bug monsters, panicking when confronted with them.

Relationships
Kaito Takagi
Sylphy has a very strong, very good relationship with her master, and always does her utmost to support him, in terms of both combat and encouragement. Whenever Kaito levels up, she will praise him, and whenever the two have alone time together, Sylphy seems to get flustered, possibly hinting at romantic feelings for him. Building a bond together through combat, they soon became very close, even more so when Kaito gained the passive boost named 'Blessing of the Gods' as a result of working so well with her. Their bond is more akin to that of close friends working together than master and servant, as Sylphy will act of her own accord to erect barriers. When Kaito acquired Luceria's card and she began to receive less cores than Luceria, she silently withdrew from Kaito somewhat, although when asked what the problem was, she opened up and revealed that she would like to be treated in a similar way, and wanted to talk to him more. Upon being promised that she would be spoken to more, Sylphy gleefully declared how glad she was that he was her master. When she leveled up for the first time and her appetite for magic cores grew, she was hesitant to ask for more, perhaps feeling she was a burden on her master for doing so. She will reprimand him when the need arises, such as not being summoned when he first joins a party of adventurers, but upon being brought out, she was praised by Kaito's friends, and appeared to enjoy the attention she received from new people, particularly when she was complimented and called cute by Miku. When Kaito ventured to floor 12 and was ambushed by a stampede, Sylphy maintained her barrier whilst being carried bridal style by him, something that made her blush. Upon seeing that Kaito was badly hurt, Sylphy was noticeably panicked, and tried to have him drink one of his potions despite being unconscious. When it didn't work in the conventional way, Sylphy administered the potion to him mouth to mouth, blushing again.

Luceria
Upon meeting Luceria, Sylphy was initially afraid of her, hiding behind Kaito when she told her off for how she spoke to their master. However, when Luceria said that her manner of speaking was not meant to be rude per se and just how demons were, Sylphy quickly warmed up to her, with the two becoming friends quickly. When Kaito began to seemingly favour Luceria and giving in to her demand for more magic cores, Sylphy began to feel jealous of her. After a talk with Kaito regarding the matter, the two were treated equally well and complimented on their combat prowess, and both grew closer to their master and one another. She has stated on occasion that she 'loves' Luceria, although this is most likely that she values her as a comrade and friend. The two have since grown very close to one another, similar to sisters, and are almost always by each other's side.

Airi, Hikari and Miku
Initially, Kaito hid his two servants from his new party after getting their approval to team up with them, worried they might see him in an inappropriate light. However, during an attack by a dinosaur-like monster, he was left with no choice but to do so, and Sylphy was praised by all three of Kaito's friends, particularly Miku. The girls were keen to bathe with them and named them both 'Miss', something Sylphy accepted.

Bellia
When Kaito summoned Bellia, it did not take long for Sylphy to reprimand the demon knight when he said he felt uncomfortable using a tungsten rod, saying that he was being rude to Kaito, and appeared visibly cross with him for doing so. When Bellia was presented with a proper sword, he initially did not reply, leading to Sylphy reprimanding him again, although upon getting over his surprise, he thanked Kaito wholeheartedly. He soon took to calling both Luceria and Sylphy 'ladies', something that both servants accepted, with Sylphy blushing at the compliment. During the monster rush when Kaito was less able to give orders, Bellia deferred to Sylphy, protecting their master whilst Luceria and Sylphy fought off the stampeding wild boars.

Abilities and Powers
In combat, Sylphy is a force to be reckoned with. She can cast Iron Maiden Wall to form a gold barrier around herself and her allies, and is able to maintain this protection for as long as she wants. Her main offensive spell is Divine Thunderbolt, an attack that deals great damage to almost every foe she comes across. She has a passive, luck boosting ability called Blessing of the Gods which makes rare drops slightly more common for her master. Upon leveling up, she gains the ability to use her spear as a physical weapon and is able to use a boosting skill called 'Song of the Valkyrie', which heightens everyone's stats as well as her own.

Iron Maiden Wall: Creates a dome-shaped golden barrier that surrounds and protects Sylphy and their allies, offering strong defense against external attacks while enclosing them in a secure space. This space can be moved if Sylphy herself is carried.

Divine Thunderbolt: Generates a powerful lightning strike, capable of delivering immense electrical force with devastating impact,

Song of the Valkyrie: Is activated by Sylphy singing, making her glow a light blue / white. Soon, her allies glow as well, and their stats are boosted based on how close Sylphy is to the party member in question. Although it had a great boost to both Kaito and Luceria, the first time he was summoned, Bellia noticed little to no change.

Goddess's Judgment: Sylphy gains immense power, a glowing image of her adult form shadowing her, as she flies at her foes and destroys them in a burst of lightning.
