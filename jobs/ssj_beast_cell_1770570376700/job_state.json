It was given its name by Piccolo.[2]\n\nThe Beast form is unique to Gohan outside of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2,[8] and when utilizing the form he is referred to as Gohan Beast[9] (孫そん 悟ご飯はん・ビースト, Son Gohan Bīsuto).[8]\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nOverview\n\nAdvertisement\nConcept and Creation\nThe beast within me - has awoken!\nGohan (Beast) in Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2\n\nToriyama stated that the name comes from the sensation that \"the wild beast within has awakened\". The initial design included pale skin and a more intimidating face with the big, upturned hair added when this was decided not to be enough.[8] Prior to this name being finalized, this form was referred to as Final Gohan[10] (最後悟飯, Saigo Gohan, lit. \"Final/Last/End Gohan\") in the storyboards.[4]\n\nIn the Dragon Ball Super anime, Gohan had previously mentioned striving for \"an ultimate form that no one has ever seen before\". Similarly, in the manga, he had brought up to Kefla his goal to evolve as his own person[11] (\"as a human\" in Viz's translation) rather than as a Saiyan.\n\nAppearance\nSuper Hero - Gohan Beast Model Sheet\nCharacter Sheet for Gohan Beast.\nThe beginning visuals of Gohan's transformation heavily resemble those of his original Super Saiyan 2 awakening. Gohan's eyes flicker and spiral from black to red before fully manifesting the form, in which his eyes become fully red with black pupils. In this state, Gohan's eyebrows turn white, while his hair turns light gray of a similar shade as Perfected Ultra Instinct, while also resembling the common hair color of a Supreme Kai, and lengthens to resemble his Super Saiyan 2 hairstyle as a boy but is quite a bit longer, resulting in his overall hair structure tilting backwards to a large degree, and finally with a single large bang in front reaching down to around his nose. His aura retains its bluish-white glow, but he also gains a reddish-magenta inner aura shrouded by magenta lightning. The eruption of his ki is so intense it resembles a massive geyser. In the Funimation dub, when using the form, Gohan's voice deepens and becomes more menacing, akin to the similarly beast-like Super Saiyan 4 form. Also, in said dub, upon first transforming, an echo of the young Super Saiyan 2 Gohan's scream can be heard in tandem with Gohan's own.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nUsage and Power\nIs that all you've got? Okay, then. Guess it's my turn.\nGohan Beast's comment to being unfazed from Cell Max's attack in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero\n\nGohan Beast is an evolved form of Gohan's Ultimate state, stemming from Gohan's continued awakenings since he was a child,[8] and is currently his strongest transformation in recent media. Piccolo believed just prior to Gohan achieving the form that he would be the strongest in the world, and in promotion for the film Toriyama referred to Gohan as being stronger than anyone, \"or so it's said\", but not having had a chance to shine recently.[12] In the film, his power was such that he defeated the weakened Cell Max with ease, while in the manga he has more difficulty but ultimately manages to overwhelm him after a brief stalemate in their Energy Clash. Bulma believes Gohan's power in the form is enough to make him potentially stronger than Goku and Vegeta. However, when Gohan Beast fought with Perfected Ultra Instinct Goku, the two appeared evenly matched, though at his maximum strength Gohan's raw power and speed appeared superior - with Gohan at one point temporarily knocking his father out of Ultra Instinct - this was balanced out by Autonomous Ultra Instinct, as well as Goku's superior combat skill. Thanks to the power of this form, Whis suggests Gohan as candidate for God of Destruction, but Beerus declines, noting he has the wrong personality for the job.[3]\n\nThanks to Piccolo teaching him control, Gohan proved able to access the form at will and keep control over it following his initial usage of it.[2] Having sensed the form from Beerus' planet but not having seen it,[1] Goku questioned if it was the Super Saiyan 2 or Super Saiyan 3 form, indicating it has a similar ki to the aforementioned transformations.[2] Whis also noted the transformation's uniqueness, remarking that it was not divine, but rather a product of Gohan's unique potential.[3]\n\nDespite Gohan's prowess with the Beast form, he still has trouble properly drawing out its full strength consistently, due to the possibility of his anger overflowing to a point where he might go berserk. Thus, he found a slight workaround: powering up to the threshold of losing control but maintaining it instead. Doing so allows Gohan to utilize Beast's maximum for a colossal burst of power and speed. Gohan himself admitted it was only a temporary solution to drawing out his power but found it effective for his current proficiency with Beast. Doing so also appears to drain Gohan's stamina rapidly, as he was tired out after using this power for only a brief amount of time.[3]\n\nGohan Beast Unfazed\nGohan Beast unfazed by Cell Max's punch\nIn Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero and its manga adaptation, Gohan achieved the form after witnessing Piccolo's apparent death at Cell Max's hand and transformed out of pure rage, much like his first Super Saiyan 2 transformation against the original Cell. In this form, he effortlessly withstood and brutally retaliated against a full power punch from Cell Max with his aura and was able to completely annihilate his Explosive Scream as well as his core with a Special Beam Cannon while Orange Piccolo was restricting the giant's movement.\n\nSometime after the events of Super Hero, Gohan trained with Piccolo to properly utilize Beast. When Carmine arrived at his house, Gohan uses Beast to confront and frighten him, only to relent and power down upon spotting Goten and Trunks in their Saiyaman outfits in Carmine's car.[1]\n\nDBS 103 03\nGohan Beast vs. Perfected Ultra Instinct Goku\nAfter Goku unexpectedly arrived[1] and brought Gohan to Beerus' planet, Gohan proved to be able to match him in battle.[2] During their first sparring match, Gohan Beast was able to keep up with his father's Perfected Ultra Instinct, using his max power workaround strategy to surpass Goku's divine speed and knock him out of the form. However, Goku's own training and significant edge in experience kept the match even.[3]\n\nAgainst Broly, after matching his base form with Ultimate, Gohan used Beast to overpower him, and still held an advantage over Broly once he turned into a Super Saiyan despite being initially surprised by the controlled transformation. Afterwards, their fight is cut short by Vegeta, who tags in for Broly and is able to keep up with Gohan Beast using Perfected Super Saiyan Blue (though Vegeta was fresh on energy having not fought anyone up to that point). Eventually, the fight devolves into an all-out slugfest between every Saiyan present, enough to leave everyone including Gohan exhausted and in base form.[3]","quantity":4,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"idbi2ol1h","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
