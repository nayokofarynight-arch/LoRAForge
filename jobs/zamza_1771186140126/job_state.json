He has various attacks up his sleeve and is very nimble, being able to easily evade attacks or suplex the player. However, some of his attacks can be easily countered. For example, if the player keeps a distance, he will attempt to either slide or do a forward flip, which the player can counter with a Blitz Attack (i.e., Axel's Grand Upper) to knock him out.\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nStreets of Rage 2\nLevel 3 (Zamza) - Main Boss. While he never summons other enemies to aid him, it is possible to drag existing enemies to the area where he appears.\nLevel 6 (Souther) - Main Boss. He will be fighting alongside with 1-3 Jets, depending on the difficulty: Stealth, Blitz, and Kite. The player only needs to beat Souther to complete the level, as the other Jets will fall.\nLevel 8 (Nail) - He is part of the Boss Gauntlet in the last stage. The player will fight him and many enemies in a cramped elevator, making this fight very difficult. Beating him rewards a chunk of health restored.\nStreets of Rage 4\nZamza appears as a secret boss in Stage 4. Much like the other \"retro bosses\", he can be challenged by picking up one of the tasers dropped by Barney and hitting the arcade machine with it.\n\nHe also appears as a random boss in the Survival Mode for the Mr. X Nightmare DLC.\n\nGallery","quantity":10,"aspectRatio":"1:1","autoTagging":false,"useSearch":false,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"},"references":[{"id":"3umjojttc","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"7fxy5kuf2","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"hip7isa33","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"id":"nberjnq0x","mimeType":"image/webp"},{"id":"kyalvslt1","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"scoutedAssets":[]}
